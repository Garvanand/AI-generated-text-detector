sample 0\n==================================================\nThis essay will analyze, discuss and prove one reason in favor of keeping the Electoral College in the United States for its presidential elections. One of the reasons to keep the electoral college is that it is better for smaller, more rural states to have more influence as opposed to larger metropolitan areas that have large populations. The electors from these states are granted two votes each. Those from larger, more populated areas are granted just one vote each. Smaller states tend to hold significant power because their two votes for president and vice president add up more than the votes of larger states that have many electors. This is because of the split of the electoral votes. Some argue that electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most votes nationally. They do not have to vote for their own state's nominee unless their state has a winner take all system. However, there are states that have adopted laws that force their electors to vote for their state's candidate. It seems that, no matter how, electors are not bound to vote for the candidate who won the most nationally. This is not always the case because of state legislatures who can overrule the electors and vote for the alternative candidate their citizens have selected for them, even if the voter lives in a state without a winner take all system.\n==================================================\nGenerated sample 1\n==================================================\nI strongly believe that the Electoral College should remain the way it is or, better yet, that we should elect the president by popular vote. This is due to the fact that the Electoral College does not accurately reflect the will of the people. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, an estimated two million more people voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump however, Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304 to 232. This means that a candidate can win a majority of the Electoral College voters while losing the popular vote! Furthermore, voting for President should be an individual citizen decision, not a state decision. The Electoral College works by awarding all of a state's electoral votes to the winner of the majority of votes in the state. This means that a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not receive any of that states electoral votes. This goes against the concept of onepersononevote, since a candidate can win the majority of votes in a state and still not win any electoral votes. By eliminating the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote, the votes of every individual will be counted, and the candidate who wins the most votes nationally will win the election. In conclusion, the Electoral College does not reflect the will of the people and votes in state are not equally weighted. It is time to elect the president by popular vote and to finally give the votes of individual citizens the weight they deserve.\n==================================================\nGenerated sample 2\n==================================================\nLimiting car use causes pollution, increases costs to users regardless of where services or services are offered. Furthermore, over use of the gas results in increased environmental degradation, harming our resources while damaging our environment.\n\nWhen consumers pay a larger amount before gasoline is refined then there are higher costs of running the engine than otherwise. There are fewer places where the gas can be purchased locally causing more problems. Car trips will usually have higher tolls which results in lost wages for the transportation worker, who goes to an unnecessary location for work and then returns home and gets to pay back his transportation back costs. The car accident rate amongst children also has increased. Car pollution can become airborne easily, contaminating children's health. Also children tend to be more careless and more often in accidents simply because of being pushed out of their cars onto the road. All of this can be done to better an already polluted Earth that is becoming increasingly damaged at a much faster rate. Limiting our vehicle use helps our citizens with a reduced budget. It also reduces pollution for local areas. Furthermore, it improves public health and makes city dwellers a wealthier society.\n\nLimiting our own usage by adopting public transportation, walking, biking, and public transport actually would be beneficial for the citizens and planet. I think its very healthy but very little others show similar sentiment mostly environmental activists who want a more environmentally clean place so it often is still looked down upon it still will bring about a very drastic price eventually but there will never be carbon credit trading or an oil recycling scheme unless people want it too.

shape=(128,), dtype=string, numpy=\narray([b'Dear senator, the system we have today used to elect the president, the Electoral College, must be changed. Instead, we should elect the president by means of a popular vote. The Electoral College is unecessary and complicated, and not to mention, outdated. Source 1 says that the Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. This begs the question, how can a system so old still be practical and in use today? This system, therefore, needs to be replaced by a national popular vote.\\n\\nThere are so many things that could go wrong with the Electoral College, such as a tie, in which the decision would go to the House of Representatives. According to Source 2, if this were to happen, than, \"the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.\" This, of course, would not reflect the nation\\'s vote, and would anger millions of people. If we elected the president by a popular vote, than the chances of this happening would be significantly more slim.\\n\\nAnother flaw of the Electoral College is that even if a presidential nominee won the popular vote, they could still lose the election. Even though some may argue that this occasion is highly unlikely, this has actually happened twice before, in 1888 and 2000, according to Source 3. \"It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote... It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.\" This is a major flaw of the Electoral College system, which is very frustrating to millions of people. Imagine how you would feel if your candidate won the majority of the nation\\'s vote, but still lost the election because of this horrible voting system. This unfair incidence could be avoided, if only we got rid of the Electoral College, and replaced it with the simple, fair, and straightforward method of the popular vote.\\n\\nThe popular vote is the preferred voting system in the United States. According to Source 2, \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" If this is the preferred voting system, and the Electoral College has so many flaws, why not change to using the popular vote? It only makes sense. Not to mention, if the Electoral College were to be thrown out, then maybe more people would come out to vote, which is important. We would then have a more accurate representation of who the nation wants as their leader.\\n\\nSome may argue that the Electoral College is a good system of electing the president, that the founding fathers knew what they were doing when they established it, and that it \"produces a clear winner,\" Source 3. But, the information given above disproves these unvalid arguements. If the Electoral College is such a great system, than why can a nominee who won the majority of the nation\\'s votes still win the election? Will it always produce a clear winner? What about the event of a tie? Or, what about when the \"winner\" did not win the majority of the votes?\\n\\nIn conclusion, the replacement of this flawed system known as the Electoral College by a national popular vote is absolutely necessary. The people are pushing for a change, and I strongly urge you, senator, to acknowledge this issue.',\n       b'Although many see driverless cars as an alternative to cars with drivers. I do not see this as an alternative for the future. The driverless cars are not making split second decisions that a car with a drive can. \"Google cars aren\\'t truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pullin in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents.\" This is a small set back, and also another reason why I do not believe in driverless cars.\\n\\nChanging roads completely would be very expensive. How long exactly would changing the road systems actually take? \"These smart-road systems worked suprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical.\" Using newer technology on cars such as the Prius. Technology has been proven to fail, so at some point this technology is bound to fail.\\n\\nCars are big computers. All the new technology being put into cars, yet this is making cars a lot like computers more than motor vehicles. Again as well all this technology is very costly. Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn\\'t something you could buy at Radio Shack. So just how driverless will the cars be in the future.\" All the technology in cars, yet humans are still needed, making calculated decisions instead of the car. \"The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.\" Texting and driving is a big problem facing many drivers today. Driverless cars have a hard time navigating through accidents. If a driver is texting and doesn\\'t notice an accident what happens then. The car can notify the driver, but the driver may still be on their phone. Driverless cars are not making split second decisions that a driver can.\\n\\n\"Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.\" Problems for future driverless cars. \"Tesla has proojected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.\" These cars are supposed to be driverless. Why should the car have autopilot 90 percent of the time instead of 100 percent? There are still problems facing driverless cars even in development today.',\n       b'Venus is our planet sister. Saying that is way to tell that Planet Venus is near our to planet, but there\\'s a difference between Venus and planet Earth and the differece is important to know it\\'s very important.\\n\\nPlanet Venus, by reading the this article you might find clues about planet venus that you never knew before. Planet venus also called by another name \"Evening Star\" Venus is one of the brightest point according to the author it says \" It light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot\". The author use this sentence to show how the Venus planet or Evening star shine. It also tell us that Venus have an atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Planet Venus is also the second planet from our sun, which is very important to.\\n\\nThe distance between Venus and Planet Earth. Venus and planet Earth are close not really really close but they are close according to the article \"Challenge of Exploring Venus\"\\n\\nthe author tell us that \" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too\". That sentence that the auhtor use describe and also give us information about which planet is the closest planet to planet Earth which is Venus. By the reading the article it\\'s also says that Venus was propable covered largely with oceans. Planet Venus also have somethings in common with planet Earth. Planet Venus has a surface of rocky they also have valley and mountains like planet Earth does.\\n\\nMore about planet Venus. Planet Venus and planet Earth does not have the same temperatures, according to the author information it says that \"Planet Venus have a temperature average over 800 degrees\". If we take our times to think about this sentence think about one hundreds (100) degrees, one hundreds (100)\\n\\ndegrees is very hot but if one hundreds (100)\\n\\ndegrees is hot think about (800) degrees it must be very hot in Planet Venus. Reason why planet venus is hot, planet Venus is hot because is close to the sun and we all know the sun is very hot and their atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experienced in our planet must be very dangerous.\\n\\nThis article give a lot of information and clues about it. It also give information about the wheater and atmospheric and it can be dangerous there.',\n       b\"There is an oppurtunity of a lifetime just waiting for you. You would get to enjoy fun, games, travel, and you'd get to help people. You could change someone's life. You could become a hero! This oppurtuntiy is to become one of the UNRRA's Seagoing Cowboys. Seagoing Cowboys travel all over the world to to recover countries that were left in ruins from wars. You would travel on a ship with animals and other cowboys to help people who's life seems to be in ruins.\\n\\nIt might just change your life, like it changed mine.\\n\\nIf you become a Seagoing Cowboy you won't regret it. It was a whole lot of fun. I got to meet other cowboys and you never get bored. When I was on board ships, especially on the way back, we played games and had some pretty fun competitions. We used to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty space that used to house animals. We fenced, boxed, and held table-tennis tournaments. It was a lot of fun!\\n\\nYou get to help people; this is a big reason to join. You get to become part of an organization that helps people who need it, desperately. You could become their hero. Becoming part of something like this changes your whole life. It made me selfless and aware of the world around me. That awareness has been with me through my whole life. Although I'm no longer a Seagoing Cowboy, I'm still aware of what's happening to people around the world and how lucky I am. I let international students and exchange visitors into my house as an effort to help.\\n\\nYou get an amazing expereince along the way. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, see Europe and China, tour a castle in Crete, see the Acropolis in Greece, and even get a view at the Panama Canal on my way to China. I wouldn't have been able to have any of these experiences if it weren't for being a Seagoing Cowboy.\\n\\nNow that you know all about the Seagoing Cowboys program and the benefits of being part of it, go sign up! You could be a person's hero. Mend the hearts of those who feel like they have nothing left. Feed those who hunger with no way to recieve food. Take the oppurtunity of a lifetime, and, maybe, it will change your whole life, like it changed mine.\",\n       b\"I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent. Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea.\\n\\nUsing this on humans isn't a good thing. If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it. How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy. What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy. Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen. Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.\\n\\nNow the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting. It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great. I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy. It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor but how far would it modify it. Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers. If so than that would be a bad thing. So many people would lose their jobs. It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing. That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me. They would just know and come help me, but I still think it is a bad idea.\\n\\nI'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion. I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered. Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.\",\n       b'By reading this article I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a great way to choose our next president or Vice president. The way the process works is by how many people have voted for that on person. Each canidate has to travel to each and every state and talk about\\xc2\\xa0 why you the people should vote for him/her. Now some citizens think that there should not be a Electoral College because they think that they are not being accounted for but when really they are. As you can see Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of Electors,who is in turn elect the president. The five main reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. These are the reason why i think that we should keep the Electoral college its a great system and its been in the United Staes for a ery long time.',\n       b\"Luke said that he could not have said no.

By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, as well as promote healthier lifestyles and more sustainable communities. This essay will explore these advantages in more detail.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. According to the passage set, passenger cars in Europe are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, and in some car-intensive areas in the United States, the percentage can reach up to 50 percent. By reducing car usage, we can lower these emissions and mitigate the negative effects of climate change. For example, in the article \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" a partial driving ban was enforced in Paris to combat smog caused by car emissions. As a result, congestion decreased by 60 percent and air quality improved.\\n\\nMoreover, limiting car usage can lead to improved air quality. The passage \"The End of Car Culture\" mentions that transportation is the second largest source of emissions in the United States, after power plants. By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can reduce air pollution and improve public health. In the example of Vauban, Germany, a car-free community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and residents report being happier and less tense without the need to rely on cars for transportation. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to overall well-being and improved quality of life.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of healthier lifestyles. When people rely less on cars, they are more likely to engage in physical activity, such as walking or cycling. In the passage \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,\" millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day. This event aimed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. By encouraging active modes of transportation, such as walking or cycling, individuals can improve their physical fitness and reduce the risk of health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles.\\n\\nIn addition to the environmental and health benefits, limiting car usage can lead to more sustainable communities. The passage \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" describes how the community of Vauban in Germany is an example of \"smart planning\" to separate suburban life from car use. This concept is being adopted globally to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. By placing stores within walking distance and promoting public transportation, communities can reduce the need for cars, decrease traffic congestion, and create more vibrant, pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are several advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing dependence on cars, we can address issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, promote healthier lifestyles, and create more sustainable communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive impact of limiting car usage in various contexts. To achieve these advantages, it is essential to prioritize alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transportation, and to plan communities that support these options.',\n       b'Everyone kowns that cars are dangerous. Think about how relaxing it would be to live life without the gases and the annoying sound of a motor that a car produce. This lead to the conclusion that automobiles are the linchpin of society.\\n\\ntheir are millions ways cars hold us back in life,think about the enormous amount of car accident happening everyday and you can save yourself by getting rid of your car kown or just limit the amount of time you use it. Automobiles are responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas in the United states. People might say the idea of limiting automobiles usage is wrong because they need cars to go places but they because automobiles are causing people money for example in source 2 \"almost 4,000 drivers were fined,accorrding to Reuters twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.\"\\n\\nPeople should understand that cars are not the only means of transportation you can ride a bike in the cities to avoide being in the traffic\\xc2\\xa0 with the cars.\\n\\nCitizens kown that if they do get a car get a plug-in or hybrid car. In source 4 sociologists\\xc2\\xa0 says\\xc2\\xa0 that the second largest source\\xc2\\xa0 Americas\\xc2\\xa0 emissions are transportation just behind power plants. Studies show that people who stopped car commuting find less reason to resume the habit.\\n\\nSo instead of using a car take a bus or a taxi. their are great advantages in limiting automobiles.',\n       b\"Advantages of limiting car usage is less car polliution from the gases released from the car and also better health from using other ways to get around such as walking or riding a bike as a form of excerise.\\n\\nTo begin with limiting car usage opens up other new options If you don't depend on a car so much. More money In your pocket because you not paying for gas nor keep the car maintance up no more.\\n\\nThe more you drive the more you polluting your air from the chemicals from the tail pipe of your vehicle hiking , biking , or skating are easy simple excerise you can you for transpertation. You'll know your environment better from exploring It these methods are better for the earth.\\n\\nIn some cities such as New York they've started a bike sharing program and Its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.\\n\\nAs of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was In January 1995. All these charges, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.\\n\\nTeens of this generation Is starting to organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car pool with friends.\\xc2\\xa0 People all around the world are starting to realize the benefits of reducing car usage and taking contol of the situation.\",\n       b'Society has made the car industry accelerate rapidly and over the years the amount of money these automobile company\\'s make only increases. However, its time to look into the advantages of limiting such car usage in our communities. Studies have shown that the use of cars only increases the amount of stress we have. Without the usage of cars we\\'re able to release such stressors Carlos Arturo Plaza stated in Andrew Selsky\\'s article \"Carfree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\". Its one thing to make the decision to start this movement on our own, but when a community becomes involved it makes a stronger impact. Car usage in America has only grown since it began however, the amount of cars being bought is beginning to show decrease. Many people are realizing that there are numerous amounts of ways to get around their city. Some are even carpooling. Although choosing other options such as the bus may take time it is still well worth the wait. We will find that many other options and opportunities come into play when we cut down on and get rid of the use of cars in our communities.\\n\\nVarious factors come into play when it comes to world pollution. One of the factors being the use of automobiles which increases the amount of air pollution thus damaging the ozone layer. The use of cars is second nature to us. We love the sense of indepence we get at the age of 16 when we can finally get our license. To point out, no one thinks on whats happening as we purchase cars. Instead, we rely on diesel gas to do the trick. Imagine cutting out the use of cars. With this detuction of car usage the amount of destruction done to the ozone layer will diminish tremendously. We will be able to experience clearer air just like the communities that participate in this action. For instance, in an article done by Robert Duffer titled \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" we can witness through testimony the wonders done by banning car usage. Normally Paris has high amounts of pollution but in order to change this the city enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air temporarily. The fact that the city had cold nights and warm days doesn\\'t do anything to help because these nights and days only allow for the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. After the banning of car usage Paris was finally able to experience clear air. \"Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 ,micrograms of particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared with the 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London... \" excerpt from source 2 \"Paris bans driving due to smog\".\\n\\nTo be clear, no one\\'s against car usage, but after considering the costs of using cars you\\'d realize its not worth it. Residents of Vanban, Germany find this statement to be true and have therefore regulated their lives around it. Elizabeth Rosenthal created an article on the residents from Germany titled \"In German Suburb, Life Goesn On Without Cars\". Here she discussed what the community has done in their no car movement. Residents here do not regret their decision to get rid of their cars and actually like it better than dealing with the uncontrollable and frustrating traffic jams. Not to mention the countless amount of car wrecks that come along with it. In this particular part of Germany the government has assisted in the movement. There are no street parking spots, driveways or home garages. Some might think its absurd but when theres no cars theres no need for such things. They have even improved sidewalks and made the city commute friendly with stores only a walk distance away. A mother from Germany gives her account of living in Vauban and states the following: \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\" She is a media trainer and a mother of two. In previous bills, 80 percent of the money from the government had gone to highways and 20 percent to other transports, but with the smart planning movement that will change within the next 6 years.\\n\\nAll in all, many factors come into play when discussing transportation within a city. However with the deduction of car use a city can recieve many benefits including an increase in money for other government spending, clearer air, happiness, more money in their pockets among many other things. We just have to decide whether enough is enough.',\n       b'I believe that the electoral college should be taken away because presidents that have won the popular vote have lost the election due to the electoral college and to me that just does not seem right \"Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency\"(source 2 Plumer 9). If it was not for the electoral college Gore would have won the election. If this country really is a government by the people and for the people then the government would get rid of the electoral college.\\n\\nThe electoral college is very outdated it has been in use sense the founding fathers made it \"The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise\" (source 1 OFR paragraph 1). it might have worked well back then but now it is outdated it has been three hundred years since it has been changed and it simply does not work that well anymore.\\n\\nIf there was no winner take all system it might just be a little more fair \"the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all-system\" (source 2 Plumer paragraph 13). Candidates do not even give every state a chance they usually just skip the state that they know they will not win over \"candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning\"(source 2 Plumer paragraph 13).\\n\\nThat is why iI think the electoral college should be taken out it is outdated, and it is unfair. If this country was really run by the people than the people would really get to pick the president. Those are my only really big issues with the electoral college, but that does not mean that I do not want to see it go.',\n       b'\"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people is feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotion,\".\\n\\nDid you know moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even produce them? \"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face while it show how much the computer can really do\",. Also just by making someone day you can make his/her smile and yourself smile because it feels great to give back to people , now i understand why leonardo da vinci made this because he had gotten tired of seeing people sad faces so by making the Mona Lisa he brought cheer and smiles to the world.\" A renowned drama coach Constantin Stanislavsky had his actors to carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating theses emotin on stage\".\\n\\nOverall Facial Actin Coding system was a great idea to put that in action and get the world to know and Nick D\\'Alto has made it better.',\n       b'Driverless cars have always been a point of interest as our technology advances. I am for driverless cars because they could make the roads safer.\\n\\nThese driverless cars are not completely driven by a computer. There are certain times where the person in the car has to take over, like work zones or accidents. However, for the most part, these cars have so many sensors and cameras in them that they can drive without the help of a human driver. This could mean that accidents that happen when the driver is distracted or incapacitated, would never happen. Once our technology advances ever furthur and these cars actualy become driverless, then they could prevent accidents.\\n\\nCars made by companies like Google or Tesla are not only interested in make a cars driverless, but they want to make a car that would be better for the environment. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a car that \"would use half of the fuel\", and Tesla\\'s focus has been on electric cars. Both of these options reduce or elimate the need for fossil fuels, therefore reducing carbon emmissions and taking better care of our environment.\\n\\nAlthough there is some serious work to be done to be able to test these cars to improve the cars to be legally considered safe, I think that the reality of driverless cars is not to far away, and that it is a good thing. They could make the road a safer place and help out our environment.',\n       b\"Succes come from failure without loss enthusiasm. Success does not come as a easy as a it sounds, succes comes from har work and failures.\\n\\nSucces is not somethig everyone can reach specally without fails and enthusiams. Fail mades people stay down but people decide if yhey want to be down or work harder until they success.\\n\\nCristiano Ronaldo is one of the best soccer playes in all the world. When he begins his soccer correar ,he was seen as a normal soccer player, he fail some many times. There were soccer games when he did not score any goals or his team loss. His enthusiasm made him work harder and harder. Hard work made him the person who he is now, he is considered by so many people the best soccer player of all the history but is wasen't easy, fails made him work harder in order to success in his correar after 15 years he keep working hard to be succefully in life.\\n\\nEnthusiam made people work harder until they reach succes. Enthusiam is the feeling that makes people go foward even they fail multiple times. When people have the type motivation fail is just a symple word becuase most of the people want to keep trying until they finally succes in life.\\n\\nMy mom is a good example , a few months ago she was trying to get her Driver Licence Permit. In order to get it she had to took a test that consist about all the rules in the road. She fail the first time, she was sad beucause she could not get her permit but she had a big motivation inside her that impulsed her to go and retake the test again. She fail the test twice , she never give up she worked hard to pass the test. She did not tooked the test 3 or 4 times, she toked 5 times until she finally passed the test and she got her permit, months later she go her Driver license. She fail so many times but she never give up. When you want to succes does not matter how many times you fail, you most get up work hard until you succes . As you can see, succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\",\n       b'A Car Free Future?\\n\\nIs the car necessary in the 21st Century? Many city planners and government officals around the globe dont think so. Car free days are becoming common place in Europe and South America, and in the German town of Freiburg, an upscale neighborhood where cars are banned, has been a kind of experiment for larger towns and cities without cars. In Paris smog levels have gotten so high, that people have been asked not to drive their cars, in order to reduce pollution levels.\\n\\nIn the United States, the number of miles driven peaked in 2005, but has dropped nine percent since then. This is largely due to the 2008 recession, but also due to more people becoming educated about the effects that cars have on the environment. More people are choosing to take public transport, or carpool, because mainly it\\'s cheap, and it\\'s good for the environment.\\n\\nMany key sociologists believe that this trend will continue. One of those sociologists is Professor Mimi Sheller, Diector of the Mobilities Research and Policy center at Drexel University. \"Different things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift\" there are many factors that point to the \"major cultural shift\" that Proffesor Shelley referred to. For example,the renewal of city centers has made the suburbs seem less appealing, and has drawn many people into the cities. Many carpooling apps have appeared in the last 2 years.\\n\\nBetter cities, more public transport, and an increase in telecommunications is the start of a global movement to reduce pollution and increase efficiency. the age of the car is coming to an end.',\n       b'people who value his ideas came be a millonarie person example when his wan t to do something like a market places or store his thinking what to put on his store his making his own decision or he came go to the expert or he came has for help the expert and autorities they came do nathing because his my ideas an things if i need too kill some body they not going they what who came do it people always do his own decision never faul the rules in this worlk thats why is so many deaths if the people are more focust to the work the work his going to be more betther the life is inportant because you only have one on this worlk you no have second time if you you dead all your familly is going to be crying i know i not going to pass this test bout is a example what i saing to life.\\n\\nlife is beautyful whit god on you thats another level that why i saing to life the life is mathers becaise with my own ideas an decision came do anything a want to do if the people are respecting his own decision are gone be bery good.',\n       b\"Driverless cars are something that will very soon be a common part of our everyday furture lives. These cars have proven to be a time saving and fuel saving option. They also allow drivers to not have to be in full control as they would have had in normal cars today. Although these would be some very helpful things and would be more economically friendly, driverless cars prove to be very risking and there are just too many questions about ensuring safety for them to be allowed today.\\n\\nDriverless cars could possibly be dangerous to the driver, other drivers, or people walking around on the street. As of now no driverless cars have been developed that are completely driverless. At any point the car could run into a problem where it needs a person's assistence. This person may not always pay attention like they should and they may not be able to interfere with the problem quick enought to prevent harm.\\n\\nIn these cars the chances of something to go wrong is likely. An accident may occur and the person to blame would be a very good question. The accident may have occured because something went wrong technologically with the car. Another possible thing is the car did not give enough time for the driver to be able to quickly react to the situation. If this were to happen would the driver be at blame because he should have been able to react quicker or should have paid more attention? Or should the car be blamed because it should have sensed the problem?\\n\\nThe chance of something going wrong with the cars and the technology is something else to pay attention to. As of today we can see that there is nearly something that goes wrong with technology daily. The chances of something going wrong with them and causing an accident is very high. The cars review sensors may not detect a young kid laying on the ground trying to recieve his ball that just rolled under the car. This car would then sense there is nothing there and roll over the poor kid. These cars may also read the road wrong or navigate wrong. These errors could cause you to drive on the wrong side of the road or take you down a one way street the wrong way. When you are driving down the road and a situation were to occur that caused you to react quickly how will the car know what to do in the certain scenario?\\n\\nDriverless cars are definitely a good way in saving your time and energy, but they also can harm you. There are many questions about how safe these cars would be and who to blame if something were to go wrong. Driverless cars are another piece of technology and something could go wrong that could quite possibly endanger the lives of many people. At this time there are too many questions about the driverless cars that need to be answered. But once they are answered and proven to be safe, driverless cars could be the next way of transportation.\",\n       b'Todays society uses automotive vehicles almoat everyday. When they go to work, to go to school, to go shopping, for fun, or anywhere they wanna go. Smog has been building up from the cars pollution for a very long time. Using Vehicles less will decrease smog, improve people\\'s health, an will be better for the earth. Using automotive transportaton less will help everyone an everything in the whole world from humans to the air we breath, from animals to the grass they eat.\\n\\nHowever, using vehicles less will decrease the smog amount all around the world. Smog affects everything so decreasing it will help everyone an everything out greatly. Banning cars for a day or bannins odd-numbered plates for just one day would help out tremendously. In\\xc2\\xa0 France they have banned odd-numbered an even-numbered plate numbers for one day each on different days. \" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban for odd-numbered platwa on tuesday.\" So even banning vehicles one day can have a huge impact on decrasing smog. An it also clears up congestion on the roads.\\n\\nHowever, by using automotive transprtation less it will improve people\\'s health. Walking, skatboarding, riding bicylces, or running will all imrove your health. If you had to go somewhere you could walk there an it would imrove your cardio. If you do this in a large city for one day a great majority of people would participate. \"In Colombia, a program took plase an millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work.\" That would greatly take a impact on the smog ratio. And all of those millions of people who participated got plenty of excersize for the day to improve their health.\\n\\nSo, by using automotive vehicles less it would tremendously help the entire Earth. Smog affects pretty much everything. The air that all the humans and animals breath in is polluted. The air is polluted so it affects the grass an vegetables that animals an humans consume for energy. It affects the trees that give off fresh oxygen so we can continue to breath. \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Not driving would take away traffic jams therefore, people would not stress as much an also traffic jams cause a gigantic amount of air pollution so not driving would greatly help the entire Earth that we live on.\\n\\nIn conclusion,\\xc2\\xa0 using automotive transportsation less would greatly help reduce smog build up, improve everyone\\'s health, and it would tremendously help the Earth. It would lower air pollution so that the air we breath in would not be harmful to us. Even if we just banned cars for one day the whole Earth would be a lot cleaner. In the U.S the numbers of miles driving peaked in 2005 an have dropped stedily since then. People are starting to drive less and less an it is greatly helping the entire world.',\n       b'I am all for these driverless cars. There are a few exceptions but for the most part i feel that they could bring a sense of relaxation and stress relief for drivers on roads. As a consumer i fell that is what feels more comfortable while traveling. As it says in the article, the driverless cars need assistance from the person driving it at all times. We could put forth funding and technology for this program and in a few years, we may just have driverless cars that could take you anywhere.\\n\\nI see that if there was to be a wreck involving one of these cars it could easily be blamed on the manufacturer. But reported as today there have been no accidents involving these cars. These cars are getting safer and safer as we speak. Although there are people assisting these cars they pretty much drive the most part for themselves.\\n\\nAs we put more research and effort with funding into these cars we could have a flawless car that is safe and ecofriendly. The driverless car may become the new trend here in the next few years. There could be zero room for mistakes and therefor making this driverless car the safest way to travel.',\n       b'While the Facial Action Coding System technology described in the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" aims to help teachers understand their students\\' emotions, its use to read student expressions in the classroom raises some valid concerns. \\n\\nOn one hand, this technology could allow teachers to gain valuable insights into how their lessons and instruction are affecting students. If a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a certain part of a lesson, it could prompt the teacher to find new ways to engage the class or reexplain a difficult concept. Identifying specific students who seem frustrated may also help teachers provide additional support to those struggling with the material. \\n\\nHowever, there are also significant downsides to constantly monitoring student emotions this way. Students should feel comfortable freely expressing a range of natural human emotions like confusion, frustration, or disinterest in class without fearing the teacher may misinterpret their facial expressions. Constantly having their emotions read and analyzed could add unnecessary pressure and stress. Students may also feel a loss of privacy and that they are being treated more like subjects in an experiment than individuals. \\n\\nOverall, while the intent of using this technology is to help improve teaching and learning, the negatives likely outweigh the positives. Teachers should focus on building strong relationships with students so they feel comfortable directly communicating how they are feeling about lessons, rather than relying on computers to interpret subtle facial cues. While the Facial Action Coding System shows potential to provide insights, monitoring students this closely on a daily basis risks compromising their well-being and autonomy in the classroom. For these reasons, its broad use does not seem prudent or valuable at this time.',\n       b'Facial action coding sytsem should be used because it is a good way to help students and people, First off i think if this is being used on students it is a really good idea because some students be needing help and they are to scared to ask for help and in this way the computer can help and make the lesson easy for the students this might give the students moure confidence of doing something and trying. Also if a student is bored this will make the lesson not as boring as it is for the student. This is a good way to help people to what if they are going through something and they need help or want to talk to somebody but dont want to tell anybody the facial action coding can let somebody know and friends or family can take action. Plus it is cool because you can find out alot of things about old pictuers, Like if you want to find out or just see how somebody is feeling you can use that. This is really cool beacsue you can find out alot of feelings on just a picture. Lets talk about the Mona Lisa , they used this on her and found out how she was feeling in that painting. She was feeling happy for the most part but a little bit of other emotions with that. This is a really cool way to communicate with people, This is also a cool way to make movies and video games better and more reall felling you know.? This can sence 44 muscle in your face and will let you know how your felling just of your expression. We have expressions every day but sometimes can be hard to tell how we are feeling. Most people dont know how other people feel but this can let other people understand what they are going through. This can also let people track the emotion they want to know if that person is feeling. Yes i do think that this system should be used. It can help alot. This would be very useful in alot of things.',\n       b'\"All of our developement since world war II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" Said David Goldberg. Nowadays Cars are our main Source when it comes to transportation.\\n\\nLimiting your car usage should absolutely be more important in todays society. It\\'s Plently of things going on around us that most are unaware about, And limiting your car usage can be one thing to start helping to prevent these issues. Most cars give off alot of Pollution in the cities you live in an that effects animals. For example: The oil spill was a major problem in the ocean and that killed alot of animals an Demolished most of the sea life environmental foodchains. The capital of France had an intensifying amount of smog, but car traffic tended to decreased 60%\\xc2\\xa0 after 5 days. Beijing China was known as the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel Fuel was the blame. You could even try those cars that dont require gas so the cities could be less polluted, But theres disadvantages to those cars as well.\\n\\nAt one point of time gas prices were sky high and people weren\\'t really satisfied with it. Now Gas prices have decreased an people are even more satisfied an happy to get gas. Saving up on gas would help out alot to in todays world as well. How? Because Everything in life has a Big Fat Price tag on it so to help save up to get better things or things you need you can probably go for not paying for Gas as much. Everyday around 5:00 or 5:30 there\\'s something called 5:00 traffic. When everyone is just about getting off work, headed to night school, going to the store, or whatever the case may be. This is the craziest time of the day to drive an your just ready to get home an dont feel like dealing with traffic.... you can take the City bus, Subway, or maybe even walk if its not far. Some people may call you crazy but it reduces the amount of money being spent on gas. its only maybe like 10cents to ride the city bus i believe...But the point is your saving money. Then by the time you finally decide \"Oh i would like to drive my car\" your tank would be full cause you havent been driving it so you wouldnt have to stop for gas. The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting \" Car Reduced\" Communities, and Legislators are starting to act. Many Experts expect public transportation to play a Larger Role in a new 6 year federal transportation bill approved this year, Said Mr. Goldberg. Walking isnt always quite bad. Look on the bright side your Burning Calories, shedding pounds, and if you run your building you Endurance. Instead of having to drive to a gym far away walk to a nearest one an have a pre workout by jogging or running there. Same thing applies to Bicycling.\\n\\nNowadays since majority of the United States own cars Traffic is horrible at certain hours of the day. Most people are too impatient for the wait or become aggressive drivers which is most likely to cause accidents. Maybe your ready to get home after a horrible day or your really tired from work an you realize your about to run into 5:00 Traffic an it\\'ll be forever until you finally get home. If taking the City Buses or subways you won\\'t have to deal with all that pressure. On a City bus you can just have a seat chit chat with other people as they hop on or just relax until you get to your destination. If your really tired you could just tell someone to wake you up when its time to. At least it\\'ll be better then you being behind the wheel. If your workplace is Walking or Bicycling distance then you should feel even better to just scroll past all the people having to deal with the traffic. \"Its a Good opportunity to take away stress and Lower Air pollution\" Said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat Bicycle with his wife.\\n\\nFellow Citizens should understand the Advantages of limiting their car usage because of the Pollution, To Save up on gas, and Less stress to deal with Traffic. Maybe one day cities would take more action an save up on gas for these reasons.',\n       b'In the past, the act of driving was a mandatory ability to possess, but as time progresses, the use of personal cars is declining. The decrease of drivers can be attributed to several events, one such event being the large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions caused by vehicles, especially cars. With society shifting to become less car centered, communities are adjusting accordingly, becoming more compressed to enable walking to ones workplace or a store. Additionally, the lowered use of cars results in a greater usage of more physical methods of transit, such as riding a bike or skating to a destination while saving the money that would have been spent on maintaining a car.\\n\\nPollution is an important issue on a global scale, having the potential to drastically impact the lives of both humans and other life forms. A large amount of pollution brings negative health effects upon most living creatures, making it essential to reduce pollution levels for the betterment of the environment. Some may think that cars don\\'t have a large influence on pollution, but \"passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some carintensive areas in the United States,\" Rosenthal Paragraph 5. Automobiles are responsible for a large portion of greenhouse gasses, as \"transportation is the second largest source of America\\'s emissions, just behind power plants,\" Rosenthal Paragraph 34. The enormous amount of pollution in some areas of the world even resulted in temporary bans of personal vehicles to reduce the smog, and at one point \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city,\" Duffer Paragraph 10. As a result of this temporary ban in the previously smog filled city of Paris, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,\" Duffer paragraph 14.\\n\\nIn order for society to shift away from the use of personal vehicles, distances between destinations must be reduced. There are experimental communities to test the effects of more compact cities, the most drastic being a Vauban, Germany, a suburb without cars. \"Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in lowcar suburban life,\" Rosenthal paragraph 6. These compacted cities have homes and stores placed close to one another, eliminating the necessity for a car or other vehicle. \"In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway,\" Rosenthal paragraph 6. Life within a smaller community saves the residents a lot of time which would have otherwise been spent on lengthy commutes. Additionally, through living in a less spread out society, people are more connected to one another, better learning their neighbors who are closer, while developing a deeper feeling of a community, by living in a closeknit zone. This reduction or even elimination of personal vehicle usage would enable more funds to be put toward public transport or pavement, as opposed to the current setup where \"80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport,\" Rosenthal paragraph 9.\\n\\nNot only does the reduction of car use have environmental, time, and societal benefits, but there are also health as well as economic benefits to be wrought from avoiding car use. When not using a personal vehicle for transportation, other methods must be applied to reach a destination. Among these methods there are choices of public transportation, riding a bike, hiking, skating, and more. By not taking a vehicle and instead commuting by foot or bike, the commuters health improves as a result of the exercise. Many claim that traveling by other methods than a car reduces stress, one such testamony coming from businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza: \"\\'It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,\\'\" Selsky paragraph 24.\\n\\nIn addition to health benefits, there are also economic benefits, as there is no need to maintain a car when one is not in use.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are various benefits to not using a car.',\n       b\"Driverless cars are coming! Google cofounder Sergey Brin thinks that there will come a time when nobody will buy cars because they wont need them. He believes that the cars would be like taxi systems and take us wherever we would need to go. Google has had cars that can drive independently under specific conditions since 2009, but is this a good thing?\\n\\nI myself believe that driverless cars could be a good and bad thing. Self independant cars would be able to help people out big time. For those who travel, they wouldn't have to stop and get a hotel because if they were tired the car would just drive them while they rest. Many people also do illegle things while driving, like talk on the phone or text. People crash cars all the time for drinking and driveing, texting, and talking on the phone. Having a car that would drive you would lower the accidents casued by these things. Having a car that drove you would save many lives. Haveing cars that would drive themselves would put many people out of jobs. Taxi services, truck driving services, limo drivers they would all get replaced by vehicals that could drive on their own. Also what if self driving cars got into a wreck? Whos at fault for that? The driver or the company that made the car and led you the buyer to belive you would be safe inside of it. How would anyone get justice out of that, they wouldn't.\\n\\nNow, I believe that there is both good and bad in having driverless cars, but if they were designed properly and taken care of they way they should be, I think that they would help out majorly. People that have ideas for the future have a lot of responsibility on them. They have to make sure that their ideas are of the better good before they let them out into the world. I hope whoever does designe these driverless cars put thought into it rather than just thinking about money.\",\n       b\"Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.\\n\\nThe shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.\\n\\nThough, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.\\n\\nIt's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.\\n\\nThis shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars.\",\n       b'Having th advantage of source the population with no more cars is what i would have done. With more people driveing behind the wheel what would happen next if you step on that road to get across while a person is driving behind th wheel over 90 miles an hour.

In my life my parents need a vehicle to get to work on time and need it to get home from a hards day at work.\\n\\nTo others its a dumb but a smart or nosmart thing to do but my opion is in between its a hard thing to agree on. Cars a effecting our population with death of people and gas and fuel that is blowing out of the rough with expenses. Prices that is excending to others minds is that is becomeing higher thatn i can ever imagine it comes and goes like in a blink of an eye you would even think it was gone until somebody told you it was.',\n       b'Venus, a very powerful, interesting, planet that needs to be explored more indepth to ease our minds, to let the curiosity subdue. Venus is absolutely a planet that deserves a our attention. Why does it deserve our attention though; is it worth our time and money? If it was not worth all these risks, why would it be a topic of matter?\\n\\nIn the passage it states,\" Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.\" Many wondering minds think about all the possibilities of what could be on Venus and if it could be similar to Earth. Venus is our neighbor, or as paragraph 2 states,\" Earth\\'s twin.\" \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\" If you had a brother or sister that close to you yet so far away wouldn\\'t you want to find out about them?\\n\\nVenus should be worth the exploration because there are so many possibilies of what could be on Venus. The passage states,\" Venus still has some features that are analogous to those close to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sedient and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.\" As crazy as it sounds, there is a chance that the sediments from Venus, and other objects like rocks, are here on Earth too. I believe that we have scientists already working on the break down of what is in these objects and how they got here.\\n\\nNASA workers have come up with the idea to send a hovering ship into orbit above Venus. Though the conditions are hard to work with, NASA has the capability to think of a way to let us receive information, pictures, and other objects from Venus. Towards the end of paragraph 5 it says, \" Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\"\\n\\nNASA should first send a demo rover out to Venus,before you send our people out. We have already discovered the conditions, like the air, and surface, of Venus. See if there is another object of surprise that could pop out of no where. Make sure everyone is geared up and ready to go before sending our people out. Once we have determined all the conditions and maybe an element of surprise, send a highly trained, willing, person out there. Not on a long 36 day mission but just a simple few days to see what evidence and new opportunities that could arise on Venus.\\n\\nThe danger side is very important to look at as well before sending our people out there. Like the passage says, \" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.\" This is one for the few risky obsticles NASA and its workers would have to overcome. Another example is, the temperature difference between the two planets. In paragraph 3 it states,\" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\"\\n\\nThough there would be many obsticles we would have to overcome to get to Venus, I believe if the United States could come together, we can go to Venus! Looking at all the great outcomes that going to Venus could give us I think it truly would be worth our time, money, and attention. All for the amazing possibilies we can uncover though this fantastic project. Despite the rough patches here and there, going to Venus would be such a win for America! The author suggests going to Venus is a \" worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents,\" and his detailed evidence proves his suggestion.',\n       b'If you don\\'t mind parking in a $ 40,000 lot or not driving. Then you should reconsider living in these countries. Vauban Germany ,Paris and Bogota Colombia. These are just a few countries that do and don\\'t allow citizens with cars to drive. Not allowing people to drive\\xc2\\xa0 is really benefitial ,It brings down the pollution and it creates a alternative for transportation for some countries.\\n\\nIn the .U.S.A the environmental protection agency started to promte \"car reduced\". Experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six-year federal transportion bill to be approved. This is good because in american there is a lot of motor vehicals and alot of pollution that needs to be decreased. In paris on the other hand had partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Another great reason why vehical use should be to limit.\\n\\nIf you wear found driving with a even or odd plate , you would be fined 22-euro ($31).In colombia for the third year in a row they have banned car use for one whole day. Not including buses and taxis. violators faced $25 fines. Most of these countries them not driving is helping reduce the pollution and smog in there countries.\\n\\nIn retospec driving in everyday life may help you ,but its also hurting you at the sametime.',\n       b'A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.\\n\\nThe smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn\\'t the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the \\'Day Without Cars\\'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)\\n\\nVauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! \"When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,\" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is \" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" (source 3)\\n\\nIn 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars. (source 1)\\n\\nLimiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.',\n       b'Limiting car usage nowadays is very well for the enviroment. Not using cars so much lowers polution, and is a great way for humans to start interacting with one-another again.\\n\\nThe \"Car-Free cities\" started in the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L1-2 states that stret parking and drivewats and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely car-free you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.\\n\\nStatistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Heidrun Wlter stated \"When I had a car I was always tense. I\\'m much happier this way\".\\n\\nIn Paris, due to near-record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\\n\\nOn certain days motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. the other days same rules apply to odd-numbered license plate owners.\\n\\nThe more cities that start doing a ban on driving cars\\' or use more enviroment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins in the air. p43 states that the Ford company is already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more enviromentally safe.\\n\\nThe rate of Kids and aduts between the ages of 16-39 getting their licenes and permits have dropped drastically within the past few years. With communication the computers and telephones, teens and alduts feel connected by talking on these devices and don\\'t feel the need as much to drive to go see a friend and find it easier to stay intouch.\\n\\nIn Bogota, Colombia millians of people hike, bike, skate or took buses to work durin a car-free day. It was the third year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Wihout Cars in the city. The turnout was large, despite the occasional rain they ecieved, that didnt stop the colombians for doing what they did.\\xc2\\xa0 \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution\" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Two other Colobian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the Day Without Cars event. The citites are generation a revolutionary change in the world.\\n\\nParks and sports centers have bloomed throught the city, sidewalks have been repaired and rush-hour has been cut.\\n\\nThe United states\\' has realized a drastic change in driving. Fewer people are getting their licenses. as of 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in 1995 (P32 L9-12).',\n       b'Technology has helped numerous people throughout time. The works of a Facial Action Coding System could help with a great deal of situations. They could help students that do online schooling with being taught a different way. It could let people know what kind of mood someone is in without talking to them. Facial Coding is another way for technology to assist everyday life. Facial Action Coding should be used.\\n\\nOnline schooling could become even better. People often go to school with a teacher so when they are confused the teacher can work with them. If computers can have this kind of facial recognition then the teacher would be able to see when you are confused. The text states,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Students can sometimes be worried about asking questions and looking stupid this gives them a chance to still learn the material but not be worried.\\n\\nPeople will be able to tell when someone is upset. Occasionally, when working for a resturant and getting someones order a hostile customer might walk up and it will be unknown they are in a mood until talking to them while with a coding system preparing for an angry customer is eaier. Friends will be able to know what kid of feelings are going on around you. People sometimes lie about their emotions to everyone but this will be a way even if someone is lying it will know. People who are suicidal will be easier to keep an eye on. When someone is sad and depressed research has shown that they can keep it bottled up and no one will know until it is too late but this technology can help prevent that.\\n\\nTechnology increases in everyone\\'s life everyday. It is meant to make our lives easier. Being able to see someones feeling from a screen will make talking to someone better. The use of tchnology has increased so much that having something that can tell emotion might help with the people around us to not feel so weird to talk someone. The way that it can help your mood was said that,\"If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" Ads can be annoying when looking at something interesting but if you have an ad about something that is important to you then you are more liekly to enjoy the web page you are already on and potentially make another purchase.\\n\\nFacial Action Coding should be used. The facts have backed up howit will postively affect people and their lives. Teachers will be able to teach and reach the maximum amount of learning. People can tell what kind of mood someone is in and choose how they should talk. Technology is so advanced that it will be useful in getting conversations started. There is nothing wrong with wanting to see how someone is feeling and what kind of mood they are in.',\n       b'Dear Senator,\\n\\nI urge you to change to elrection by popular vote. I feel that we have out grown the Electoral College and need a change. I think it would be more fair for everybody to if we elect a president by popular vote because of the disaster factor. Electors could always defy the will for people. It is possible with the Electoral College That the most popular vote could no go to the most popular vote.\\n\\nDoes it seem fair that people will not get\\xc2\\xa0 whome the majority vote for. The fact that this could happen scares me to be quite honest. The Electoral College is out dated and irrational. Even the best argumentsin favor are without much basis in reality.\\n\\nI ask you to rethink the Electoral College. It is outdated and I think that we need a change. This change could be really benificial and would be in everyones best intrest.',\n       b\"When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but your group work more than the rest of the class do you think it's fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self-esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praising when the student make your best effort.\\n\\nFor example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't worry about his project. Some students are more lazy than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort.\\n\\nHowever, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize student's work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students.\\n\\nIn conclusion the teachers only need recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Student's with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.\",\n       b\"The electoral college has been a part of the united states for many years. The founding fathers were the ones who established it in the constitution. The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. If you are reading this senator of state I hope this letter will support your opinion on this or make you consider popular vote.\\n\\nThe united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states. With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the opposing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.\\n\\nThe electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnertakeall system in all the states, because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only focus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisements all over the country.\\n\\nEven though the popular vote is a good way to go I think that this system of electing president is still not perfect or will never be perfect. The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and should be used in future elections. If you have read this senator I hope this might have changed or supported your opinion on this topic.\",\n       b\"My position on driveless cars are bad because i don't trust them. I have a couple reasons why i don't trust them. My first reason is accidents. Driveless cars could have a sytem malfunction and drive off course and something breaks and crash into somthing. This could happen to anyone such as police, buses, and simple pedestrians.\\n\\nMy second reason is too many driveless cars. If there were to make way too many drivless cars then it would alot of traffic because there are alot of cars who need a driver to drive. Such as if they were to go to the junk yard the junk yards would overflow and they would have to make more and more and less places to build houses or less crops for farmers.\\n\\nMy last reason is pollution. If aot of people bought all these driveless cars then so much pollution would comeup and take over the sky and people would get sick and die from breathing in the air. If they were to change gas into something else and something went wrong with the gas or something to run the cars, they would either blow up or cause to much pollution that they would have to refund all the people and people would stop buying these because they wouldn't trust them.\\n\\nThat's why i say no to driveless cars.\",\n       b'do you think that these classes should be electives or a core class?.I say that it should be an elecitve because some peole are taking it as electives and so they cahn graduate on time thats why i say they should make theses classes go for elecitives and kids will like more drama and art and or music classes. more than core classes cause core classses are required for gradutaion and the elecitves are for fun and i think that the school should give these classes as an elecitve because it will be fun to learn new things and explore what you would be good at.\\n\\nsome people may believe that you should take a music class,or art class,or drama class however; i believe That those classes should be electives cause their less important then the core classes. but at the same time it would be fun to have one of those classes. and so you expiernce something new. and you get to meet new and differnt people and thats why it should be an elective.',\n       b\"Electric cars are a good thing for the future. It will be a while before they are perfected. However, I think they will have a positive impact on the road.\\n\\nMy first reason for thinking electric cars are good is the sensors. In paragraph 4 It talks about all the sensors in a Toyota Prius. This helps driver out with a lot of things.\\n\\nSecond is the Elictric car's ability to detect things in certain situations. So this will help out with places that are hard to see. This feature Will prevent a lot of wrecks from happening.\\n\\nIn paragraph 9 it says laws are against these cars. Paragraph 6 talks about how they are very limited right now. However, this is what time is for. They are not perfect right now,but there will be a lot more of them in 5 to 10 years when the improve even more.\\n\\nThey will be good for the road in a few years. The sensors will help out a whole lot. Lasst the ability to detect certain things will decrease the amount of wrecks. Therefore Electric cars will have a positive impact on the road.\",\n       b'Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nIn recent times, there has been a growing awareness and concern towards the challenges and issues associated with excessive car usage. From cities like Vauban in Germany to Bogota in Colombia, there are examples of communities that have chosen to limit car usage and witnessed significant improvements in the quality of life and environmental conditions (Rosenthal, Selsky). This essay aims to present a compelling case for limiting car usage by highlighting its advantages including reduced greenhouse emissions, improved public health, and enriched community life, drawing evidence from global initiatives.\\n\\nThere is ample scientific evidence that excessive car usage contributes significantly to the global greenhouse gas emissions, thereby fueling the climate change crisis. In fact, passenger cars account for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal). Additionally, cities that favor car usage frequently contend with smog and poor air quality, as demonstrated by situations in Paris (Duffer). Prioritizing alternative modes of transport reduces our dependence on cars, contributing substantially to mitigating climate change. \\n\\nThe public health benefits of limiting car usage are substantial. Cities with fewer cars have been shown to have lower levels of air pollution, thereby contributing to improvements in respiratory health among its citizens. This assertion gets further substantiated by the partial driving ban in Paris, which reduced congestion by 60% to contain the smog crisis (Duffer). Moreover, transforming cities to be less car-dependent also promotes physical activity such as walking or cycling, thereby combating sedentary lifestyles, and their associated health concerns such as obesity and heart disease. Bogota\\'s \"Day Without Cars\" is a testament to this, where millions participated, engaging in physically active modes of transportation (Selsky). \\n\\nLastly, reduced car usage fosters enriched community life, leading to quieter, safer, and more vibrant local neighborhoods. The suburb of Vauban in Germany, where 70% of the families do not own cars, is an excellent illustration of this, where the streets echo with the sound of children and bicycles rather than motor engines (Rosenthal). Also, urban design that favours reduction in car usage usually involves allocating more space for parks, social centers and broad, smooth sidewalks, enhancing the infrastructure for community interactions (Selsky). \\n\\nIn conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage go beyond environmental protection to include health benefits and enhanced community life. As emphasized by sociologist Mimi Sheller, the trend of America\\'s cooling love affair with vehicles signals a long-term cultural shift (Rosenthal). While it is true that cars can provide convenience and flexibility, it is important to weigh these benefits against the wider societal and environmental impacts. As citizens, it is our collective responsibility to support and advocate for policies and practices that promote alternative modes of transportation, not only for our sake but also for future generations.',\n       b\"If it were a real martian creation then you would be able to see possible life forms around it and it wouldn't be facing towards the sky, it would be like a statue, plus it would have been a really fantastic descovery and we would try to make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive on the planet so we could possibly live there one day. NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures. Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it. But as you can see in the pictures it's just a messa, a natural cause in nature, something that happens on earth, but it just so happened to look so much like a face from the possible clouds and blurry picture from the first. Many people at NASA want wanted that to be a statue or something that a living creaturs has made, but as you see in the pictures it starts to look more like a natural cause of natural cause.\",\n       b'Automobile accidents are very common in suburbs and in cities. Car reduced communities would not only help help us us a world financially but also help when it comes to our health. Robert Duffer and Elisabeth Rosenthal explain and inform the advantages of limiting car usage.\\n\\nCars in this day in age seem like a necessity when it comes to transportation but cars being the main source of transportation isn\\'t always a good thing. Many countries are beginning to promote the philosophy of car reduced communities. According to David Goldberg, \" All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change \". Cars being the main focus of transportation is not good. The gases from the fuel produces pollution which eventually leads to harmful diseases. We should take more advantage of our technological advances and come up with a safer, effective, and more economical way to transport our everyday citizens. Imagine if we stopped using cars. The air we breath in day by day would be cleaner, we would all have more money, and their would be less automotive accidents day by day which is one of the main reasons are population isn\\'t increasing as fast as it could. Smog is the main harmful effect of abusing our car usage. Source 2 states that \" After days of nearrecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving bam to clear the air of the global city \". The city of Paris is probably one of the most visited city in the entire world so for them to have to stop car usage due to smog is a big deal. Studies have shown that cars are very dangerous and harmful yet we still drive them everyday unconcontious of the fact that day by day were slowly making it harder on ourselves as humans to even survive. Cars are the main source of transportation now a days but its clear to see that the use of cars opposes many disadvantages.\\n\\nCarfree days would be very effective when it comes to the conservation of our people. bogota Colombia has come up with the idea of car free days but is this idea more effective them it is ineffective? According to Source 3 \" It was he third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of & million \". You can only imagine how positive this idea actually ended up being. Many people thought that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. Having many more of these days world wide wouldn\\'t harm us unless we allow it to becasuse we\\'ve become so dependable on these machines but it would would help our planet become cleaner which tends to relieve stress. With the realization of the fact that cars are better helpful then they are harmful many people may stop buying cars. Source 4 claims that \" President Obama\\'s ambitious goals to curb the United States\\' greenhouse gas emission, unveiled last week, will get a fortutious assist from an incepient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, drving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by \". Many citizens are beginnning to focus and understand that presrving our populaiton is more important then going where they want when they want to. The concept of carfree days seems to be the better route to choose when it comes to survival, living, and a stressless environment.\\n\\nAutomible accidents are becoming very common in surburbs and cities. We as a people need to more contious on healthier and cleaner communities so that we can begin to produce healthier children. Healthier children means focused children and citizens. Children that are focused on having goals and having careers that help our planet.\\n\\nWe should make the smarter decision to be less selfish and more selfless so we as a people should reduce car usage so we can continute to grow as a population, culltivate, and explore together.',\n       b'I think we should keep the Electoral College. For one reason is its in our Constitution. You cant just go back and erase it off the Constitution. The other thing is you have to be an qualified citizen. Sorry but i dont want a comenest to vote for our president.\\n\\nThe Electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportonment\\xc2\\xa0 of the senate decreed in the constitution. So your getting back some of what you put in, it is a win win situation. If you keep the Electoral college you get certainty of out come. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it happend in 2000.\\n\\nEveryones president. The electoral college requries a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The electoral college can be argued that its method of selecting the president my turn off voters for a candidate who has no hope of carring there state.\\n\\nyou can also avoid run off elections. The Electoral college avoids the oroblems of and election. Like when Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority in Electoral college.\\n\\nThis is my reasons why i would keep the Electoral college.',\n       b'In the article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", I learned thet computers can now feel what emotions that you are feeling. This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.\\n\\nI think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.\\n\\nBut there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.\\n\\nSo in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test. But in all I do believe that if these were to come into our schools I would just hope one thing, and that is to be graduated befor that time comes.',\n       b'The way of seeing how kids feel in a class room, this new technolgy shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the class room, lets find out.\\n\\nProfessor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universty of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the Universty of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an \"action unit\".\\n\\nI support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in class rooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn\\'t have this type technolgy. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technogly in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have post poned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed alot of confusion over the section. That could have saved alot of time and get better grades, as they could of not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over a answer if a student or students or confused what is going.\\n\\nThere are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, suprise,anger,digust,fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.\\n\\nIn fact, we humans preform this same impressive \"calculation\" everyday. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. Its that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can\\'t.\\n\\nIf we had this in a class room , this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceling areas, Thearpists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie dector, shows the emotions. Say they can\\'t get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of alot things in every day life. This could also mean that, school corportaions might recieve rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don\\'t have some of the newest technolgy as some other schools due, and why because i go to a small school, so we don\\'t recieve high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why i agree we should have this newest technolgy and alot of the schools, to suceed in life and to help kids get better.',\n       b\"Although exploring Venus would be dificult, it would add enormous amounts of knowledge about the possibility of other life forms. However, none of the spacecrafts that have arrived at Venus had a long life span. In order to send humans to Venus, NASA needs to find out how to get through Venus's hefty atmosphere. The author presumes that if NASA can get people to Venus though, the rock and air samples would conclude if our alien counterparts had once thrived there.\\n\\nDespite Venus's toxic atmosphere and unhabitable heat that is currently present, the author stated that, years ago, Venus was likely to be covered in large oceans that could have supported many different life forms. Astronomers see that Venus is very equatible to Earth. With its rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and craters. The idea of Venus being so alike has brought greater attention to the thought of sending humans to the planet. Nasa had planned to hover over the thick atmosphere of Venus, but the results of that would be imennsely limited because they would never break the atmosphere.\\n\\nOverall, Nasa has found that Venus will be stupendously hard to study, but worth it to start thinking of the possiblities. With the intense heat and pressure in mind they have not yet found a way to land humans, or even small spacecrafts, on the planet. But human curiosity will lead us into many intimidating endeavors.\",\n       b'In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think using the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read students\\' emotional expressions in a classroom. I think this because if a student is bored or tired, you can tell just by their face on how they feel. Also, this new technology system could help humans learn how to use their muscles in order to make them smile again. In the next two paragraphs, I will explain using eveidence from this article on how this is true.\\n\\nUsing the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System shows how you feel just by the look on your face. In paragraph 5 it states \"In face, we humans perform this same impressive \"calculation\" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look her on face... Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions... His new computer software update stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.\" This statement from the text is saying how humans show emotions just by their face. This detail states how using the new technology shows us more on how a person is feeling.\\n\\nThe new technology called the Facial Action Coding System also shows humans on how to learn to move their facial muscles. In paragraph 9 it states \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help you produce them... Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person\\'s facial expressions.\" This is stating that if you use your facial muscles, you can actually start to feel slightly happy. This detail explains how using your facial expressions can actually make you feel slightly happy.\\n\\nIn the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" this new technology the Facial Action Coding System is valuable with students in a classroom. We can tell by students\\' faces on how they feel, but the new technology helps us figure out their emotions even more. The technology is a very good use if you want to figure out someone\\'s emotions. This can also help students realize what they actually feel and start moving their facial muscles to make them feel slightly happy again. The more you move your facial muscles the slightly happier you will get!',\n       b'Voting for president should be fair and democratic to all the people. Decisions for the country that affect the people should ultimately be determined by them since their lives could be greatly impacted by those decisions. Today, the country determines the election of the president of the United States by using the electoral college. Although the electoral college is effective in many ways, does it really portray what the people want? Changing the election to election by popular vote would determine what the people want in a more democratic and fair way. The United States was built upon democracy and that strong profile should be kept.\\n\\nThe electoral college is a process by which voters vote for electors that elect the president determined by their political party. In theory it may seem like an effective process, but it can bring many problems. Source 2 says that the single best argument we have against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election crisis of 2000 was because of the electoral college process and that even worse things could have happened. The electoral college has brought a lot of problems. \"In the same vein, \\'faithless\\' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please,\" (Source 2). Electors refusing to vote for their party\\'s candidtate, or refusing to vote altogether could lead to things like Hawaii sending two slates of electors to Congress in 1960. The electoral college system leads to a lot of complications and using popular vote would make the process simpler.\\n\\nVoting by the electoral college can bring unfairness to the voting process. Source 3 explains that when you vote for a presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors. Your votes do not directly go to the president you want, so even if a president wins the popular vote, they could still lose the electoral college vote and the election all together. \"A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely....,\" (Source 3). Voting by popular vote would not allow this to happen because of the amount of people voting and the likelihood of that happening is even less. Also, the fairness of small states and big states is not democratic in the electoral college process. Since larger states have a greater population, they tend to get more attention than smaller states do. There would clearly be more equality in voting by popular vote than in the electoral college.\\n\\n\"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a poplular vote of qualified citizens,\" (Source 1). Although this compromise was good in theory at the time, the process is not very fair and does not bring the right people to be elected as electors. The electors are chosen depending on how they reach certain criteria by the law. These laws vary though, which could bring a wide variety of people from each state. This would give some states the upper hand compared to others. There would be no worry about the certain people chosen as electors in the process of popular vote.\\n\\nThe electoral college brings complications, unfairness, and the worry of chosing electors from each state. The Untited States was built upon the idea of general democracy and the process of the electoral college does not carry out that idea. Chosing the president by popular vote would give the people a more democratic way of chosing whom they want to be in charge of the country. The people of the country are the ones most impacted by decisions of the country, so they should have more of a say in what is decided.',\n       b'To State Senator, Electoral college. What a complex process it has become. I am writing to you today to explain to you why the Electoral College should be held. As you know, this is a process which starts off by\\xc2\\xa0 a meeting of the electors to discuss and vote for the President and the Vice President of United States, then counting the electoral votes by the Congress. The Electoral College isnt a small thing, it consists of 538 electors. It requires at least 270 votes to elect the President.\\n\\nEvery candidate running has his/her own group of electors. Most states have as its called \"winner-take-all\" system. Which basically, gives all the electors the opportunity to the winning presidential candidate. When the president is elected, the governor sets up a \"Certificate of Ascertainment\". Which concludes a list of names of all the candidates who ran for President. The certificate is then sent to Congress and the National Archives as apart of the presidential election and history.\\n\\nIt has come to my attention that there has been a majority of people who do not agree with the Electoral College and wish for it to be abolished. A source says and I quote, \" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, who in turn elect the president.\" Although, this source only has ONE argument against the Electoral College, which is called the disastor factor. It explains that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest mistake in a century, and how it couldve been worse. In all honesty, if it was going to be as worse... then it wouldve. But it did not so why they spend so much time stressing about something that does not exist.\\n\\nIt also mentions that\\xc2\\xa0 if a tie were to happen in the electoral votes, the election would be thrown out of the House of Representatives and the state delegations vote for the president.\\xc2\\xa0 IF a tie were to appear, i doubt very much that it will happen because the people campaign for the president they want in the White house, so they persuade people causing one to have most votes. But in all worst cases, that is why there is a Vice-President. The Vice-President serves a purpose and should be treated like so.\\n\\nThere are 5 reasons to keep out Electoral College: Certainty of Outcome, Everyone\\'s President, Swing states, Big states, and Avoid run off elections. Certainty of outcome includes that yes, anything is possible, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College, but it is very less likely than a popular vote. The winning candidates share of the college go past his share of popular vote. Everyone\\'s President inlcudes that the college requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. Meaning that if it has no region, the electoral votes are already enough votes to select the president.\\n\\nSwing states consists of the winner-take-all system as mentioned earlier. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the campaign in toss-up states, to really understand what is hapeneing even though they already know what their final desicions is. The most humble and heartfelt voters should be the ones to decide the election. And of course the big states. In other words, the larger the state equals the more attention from presidential candidates in a campiagn than a smaller state. An example, would be that Florida recieved 29 electoral votes for the current president, rather than Wyoming which only got 3. And finally to conclude, the Avoid run-off elections. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate is favorited. There of course is pressure in run off when no candidate wins a majority of cast votes.\\n\\nTo end this letter sent to you, State senator. I have explained to you the process of the electoral votes. I also explaind the reasons why you should keep the Electoral College held. Please rethink this over and consider the best option...To keep held the Electoral College. Best wishes.',\n       b'To whome this may concern the electoral college is out dated and unfair. Examples of this would be that bias can take up a\\xc2\\xa0 big part of it. For example if an electoral does not like who is running for president on the winning side they can bend the votes into there favor. Another example would be in the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of representives witch would be another unfair vote, beacuse each representive stands for everyone in the state. So if the representive in MA was demcrait and the representive in TX was republican then the mjorty vote would most likely go to the republicans.\\n\\nOther examples of how unfair the system is the \"winner take all\" system. Reasons it is unfair is that the the running candidates don\\'t go to states if they no they are going to win or not. Some states don\\'t even get to see the adds for some candudates beacuse that stat mjorty is either repubclain or demacrat. That is unfair to the people\\xc2\\xa0 that are in the oppsite party in that state. Futher more the system is unfair to people in states where the mjorty is something diffrent from the party they are in.\\n\\nLast but not least the system is out dated. The electoral college has been around since the constution was writen but since then it has gone down hill with the bias and mjorty votes. Examples of this can be found int the two parragraphs above as well as in this one. Another example why is out dated and unfair is the people most likely do not have a say in who they pick. a reason for this would be the bias the members of the electoral have to a candidate. The vote they cast has a grater power over ours and can sway the vote to there favor is they want to. More reasons would be how the electoral college has been around since the constution. although other systems from that time still seem to work this one does not and it will continue to fail until it just stops working altogether.\\n\\nIn concluestion the electoral college needs to be changed due to the bias in the system along with the unfairness of the system. Also the age of the system and the fact that it seems to keep failing,And not showing any signs that it will get better. Or help with elections in a fair and approiate way. Later on in other elections.',\n       b'United States of America, the land of the people right? When people think of America they think of freedom, so isn\\'t it our job to keep it that way? With our electoral college, the people of America aren\\'t truly given the right to where their vote matters. The electoral college has so many flaws such as the disaster factor, risk of a tie, and even how unfair it is to our countries voters.\\n\\nThe disaster factor is the risk that the electors could always defy the will of the people. The electors are picked by state legislatures, so it could easily happen where electors disobey the right citizens have and do what they choose, or the legislatures replace electors with maleficent unpatriotic electors that will try to cheat the vote. How is that fair to us? Knowing that thousands and thousands of voters dedicate their time to focusing on which candidate is truly the most deserving, proactive, and thoughtfull. \"Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. In the same vein, \"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party\\'s candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" The Office of the Federal Register. Here was a time where had already been done, and it is sure to happen again.\\n\\nOverall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of other people. For example, \"Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning...\" The Office of the Federal Register , this shows how it is not really fair to all the states as even if the popular vote comes close, the winning candidate takes all the electoral votes.\\n\\nIt is possible as well for the electoral votes to tie for both candidates, in which case if this were to happen it would be a catastrophe, as the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. \"...the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 million voters\" The Office of the Federal Register. The population difference between the two is beyond comparable with California exceeding Wyoming with over 30 million voters. And to know that the two states would each get one vote? How is that, in any way possible, fair to American voters.\\n\\nWith so many problems with the electoral college and it being unimaginably unjust, the common thought would be how could this possibly still be the final word of our presidential election. If the Disaster factor, risk of a tie, and undoubting unfairness still haven\\'t woken up our government, then how far and much destruction of our country\\'s freedom will it take for the United States of America to truly be, the land of the people.',\n       b'Car accidents have become a growing problem around the world. Anything from drunk driving to texting and driving has caused people to injure and even take the lives of many people. The development of computer-driven cars have the purpose of using innovative technology to prevent these events from occuring while also allowing drivers to have more freedom behind the wheel. Everyone should switch to computer-driven cars once they are fully developed because they contain sensors that allow the car to carry out many of its own functions, are able to alert the driver if their assistance is needed, and have in-car systems that prevent accidents that would occur through texting and driving.\\n\\nTo begin, these computer-driven cars already have many featurres that allow the car to do the same thing as if a human was driving. The article on driverless cars states,\\xc2\\xa8 BMW announced the development of\\n\\n\\xc2\\xa8Traffic Jam assistant.\\xc2\\xa8 The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph.\\xc2\\xa8(driverless cars are coming 7) allowing everyday drives to the gas station or the grocery store to be eliminated and the simple act of getting into the car as if it were a cab, to be carried out. Also,\\xc2\\xa8 They can steer, acelerate, and brake themselves.\\xc2\\xa8 (driverless cars are coming 7) shows that the cars are just as handy as if a human was driving them.\\n\\nNext, other sensors alert the driver as needed. In case there is construction or another type of barrier that might confuse a driverless car, there are sensors to alert the human in the car that they are needed. The driverless cars will have installed,\\xc2\\xa8 in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.\\xc2\\xa8(driverless cars are coming 8) allowing for a fun \\xc2\\xa8Drive\\xc2\\xa8 to the destination while also having a safe one. To further support this idea,\"Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over.\\xc2\\xa8 (driverless cars are coming 8) reassures the idea that one can enjoy the ride while also knowing they are safe and can take over when necessary.\\n\\nLastly, driverless cars can prevent accidents caused by cell phone use while driving. Cell phone users are not aware of where the car is going if they are looking at their phone. When the article says,\\xc2\\xa8 something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone.\\xc2\\xa8 (driverless cars are coming 8) reffering to the heads-up system, it creates a feeling of saftey knowing one can still be interacting with technology while being aware of what is going on with the car. Also, \\xc2\\xa8 In this way, the car-system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.\\xc2\\xa8 ( driverless cars are coming 8) seals the deal that driverless cars are a innovative new way to prevent accidents through cell phone use.\\n\\nThe ability to carry out similar functions as if a human were driving, the addition of sensors that alert the driver when needed, and the ability to prevent more car accidents through cell phone use are what make driverless cars a necessity to the world. Though some have argued it would be hard to trust the technology, tests have proven otherwise. The technology and innovativness of the car are very promising. Ultimately, having a driverless cars is what everyone needs.',\n       b\"Dear or. Senator, I believe that America should keep the Electoral College to elect the president of the United States. I believe this because the Electoral College makes a guaranteed outcome, it gives proper representation to big states, and the president has to have a transregional appeal.\\n\\nThe Electoral College has more of a certainty of outcome for an election. For example, in the 2012 election, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes a very convincing number but only 51.3% of the popular vote not as convincing. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of a tie in the votes. Even though the Electoral College has 538 votes, which would make it possible for a tie, it is very unlikely that there is a tie in the Electoral College. For example, Richard Nixon in 1968 only received 43% of the popular votes, but won 301237 in the Electoral College. Bill Clinton in 1992 had only 43% of the popular vote, but also won 370168. The pressure of a runoff election is reduced with the Electoral College.\\n\\nThe Electoral College gives the big states more representation than the smaller states. For example, Florida has 29 Electoral votes, while a state like Maine only has 4. In 2012, the popular vote was really close in Florida, but Obama won and got 29 electoral votes. If the same thing happened in Maine, the winner would only receive 3 Electoral votes. If America used the popular vote to decide who won, the win by a few votes would mean almost nothing, and the big states would have the same representation as the small states.\\n\\nThe president can't win the election by just winning one region of states. The Electoral College has made it that the candidate would have to have a transregional appeal. This is desirable for most people because a president that is only popular in one region, and not everywhere will not be a good president. This is why candidates don't campaign in places that they know they will win, and branch out to the swing states. These swing states basically decide the election. They are the states that do not favor either the democratic or republican candidate, so they have important votes. If swing states go one way, so will the election. This is why many candidates campaign in these Swing States.\\n\\nAs you can see or. Senator, the Electoral College is the best way to go for electing a new president. It has a more certain and guaranteed outcome than the popular vote, it gives more representation to the bigger states, and requires appeal from people all over America, not just people in one region.\",\n       b'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports this idea very well by explaing different aspects of Venus that make it highly worth studying. when the author explains why we should explore Venus one of the statements that i was most intrigued by was was when the author stated that \"long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth\", the reason i think this is a very good reason on why we should explore venus is because it could help give us a better understanding of our universe, mabye human like creatures lived on venus at one time, maybe there were buildings on venus, the possibilities are endless. This is why i think that the author makes a great claim about exploring venus and why i think we should further explore venus.',\n       b'Limiting car usage has many benefits for modern societies. According to multiple sources, reducing reliance on personal vehicles can significantly improve public health, the environment, and urban transportation systems.\\n\\nOne major advantage of limiting car usage is improved air quality and public health. As passages 1 and 2 discuss, vehicle emissions are a leading cause of air pollution in most cities. By driving less and using alternative modes of transportation like biking, walking, and public transit, communities can lower emissions of harmful gases and tiny airborne particles. This results in cleaner, healthier air for all residents to breathe. With less pollution, people are less likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses and disease over time. \\n\\nIn addition, limiting car use has environmental advantages. As noted in passage 3, automobile dependence negatively impacts natural ecosystems and contributes to climate change. When fewer gas-powered vehicles congest roads and highways each day, it lessens fossil fuel consumption and the volume of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere. With reduced emissions per capita, countries can get closer to achieving emissions reduction targets and mitigating the impacts of global warming. Nature also benefits as surrounding habitats regain some quality of air, water, and livability impaired by vehicle emissions and sprawl over decades.\\n\\nFinally, curbing car dependency can improve urban infrastructure and transportation flows in crowded cities. As described in passage 4, when mass transit options are more heavily relied on instead of private vehicles, it allows municipalities to reshape road and parking space for other uses. Buses, bikes, and pedestrians require less infrastructure than endless highways and parking lots. Streamlining transportation in this way leads to less traffic, commute times shorten, and space is opened for green developments or other civic projects that serve more people efficiently. \\n\\nIn summary, limiting car usage produces a wide range of environmental, health, and infrastructure advantages for modern societies. By driving less and embracing alternatives like public transit, biking and walking, communities can significantly boost quality of life and sustainability over the long run. A multi-modal approach balancing various transportation options is clearly better for people and planet than unsustainable automobile dependence.',\n       b\"Introduction:\\n\\nHey everyone!

Author Nick D\\'Alto wrote the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" educating readers on the new facial expression innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe. Dr. Huang and his colleague use this tool to find new ways for computers and humans to communicate. This new system brings a new type of learning, allowing the students to retain and understand information better.\\n\\nD\\'Alto is the writer, but Dr. Huang has emphasized that FACS would bring the students a new type of online learning, making them more interested in the lesson. Dr. Huang explains this innovation as he says, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor.\" (Paragraph 6). This new change would make the lesson more beneficial to the student as it would make the student more interested in the lesson, further allowing them to retain information better later on.\\n\\nThe lesson may be beneficial to the student academically, but is it causing mental health issues as it supports more screen time? FACS is all computer based, meaning less time in the classroom and more time infront of the computer. The student would be conducting this program on a school computer as D\\'Alto explains, \"Your home PC can\\'t handle the complex algorithms\" (Paragraph 7) the program ends up promoting more screen time, something that students should get less of, instead of human interaction, which our society needs more of. In a way FACS program is not beneficial or valuable to the student mentally as it promotes something that our society needs less of.\\n\\nThis technology could be also very beneficial to those who do not have the best teacher or education available to them. When FACS makes that facial emotion recognition it adjust the lesson, allowing the students to understand the lesson better, as Dr. Huang explained. This would be beneficial to students who have a poor education environment as their teachers might not recognize these facial expressions, causing the student to not understand the lesson which later leads them to falling behind in class.\\n\\nThis new technology has many pros and cons, but also brings students a new way of understanding. FACS could possibly bring grades up along with educational improvement. This program may support more screen time, causing students mental health issues, along with eyesight to deteriorate, but if this program is used wisely, none of those things should happen. This new technology should bring a new way of understanding, making FACS a valuable resource to students.',\n       b'The electoral college was a great attempt to give a reliable system of selecting the president, but it just does not work the way our founding fathers wanted it to. Many people throughout the country have brought this up as a major issue because they also agree. The other option that people would prefer to have would be selecting the president by the popular vote, which is the smarter path. This method is more democratic, it has a smaller chance of producing unreliable results, and it\\xc2\\xa0 encourages voters to still vote in states where there is already a predominant political party.\\n\\nThe electoral college is not democratic. The method of selecting people for it is generally controlled by each candidate\\'s political party, and their responsibilities vary based on the party\\'s wants. The people who select the candidates for the electoral college are not part of the popular population; they are part of a political party. Next, when people go to vote for the president, they are not voting for the president, but actually voting for a slate of electors that in their turn vote for the president. And to take this to the next step, as shown in \"What Is the Electoral College?\", \"Most states have a winner-takes-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If voters vote for the candidate that ends up losing, poof, all their votes are given to the other team. To atleast make this a little more fair, instead of voting for the president, voters should cast votes for the electoral college members that are choosing their president. That way, you can at least do research on the people whom you are really voting for and make the best decision possible.\\n\\nThe popular vote is the most reliable way to get results from the people. It is the most raw, unbreakable way of selecting the highest political figure of the country. On the other hand, the electoral college\\'s slight stretches have the possibility of unreliable results. In \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", it becomes known that \"...thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - [Al Gore] won the popular vote but lost the presidency\". It is still argued that the electoral members chosen are extremely trustworthy :\"each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)\" (from \"In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"). However, even in the continuation of the fragment above, even Richard A. Posner (,the author,) admits \"[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national vote.\" The electoral college members are trusted to vote for whom they were voted for, but their job is to be a highly knowledgeable political expert; and if they see the other president as a better choice, then it can become very unfair.\\n\\nThe electoral college discourages people to vote in countries where there is already a dominating party. For example, California is mostly a democratic country that usually casts a (highly populated) vote for the democratic party\\'s electoral candidates. So why should republicans consider voting in this area? The government has always tried to push out that \"every vote counts\", but is this really the case? Another good point of this is explained by Bradford Plumer again in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong\" : \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races of \\'swing\\' states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina...\" Swing states, as the\\'re called, are the places where presidential candidates always hang around. They barely bother with the other states because they know they have already got or lost the vote in them...\\n\\nSome laws were brilliantly passed, but had to eventually be deconstructed due to present implications. The electoral college is not democratic, doesn\\'t produce reliale results, and discourages voters. It is time that we abolish this college just at we overturned the eighteenth amendment before.',\n       b'It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some poeple think the impressions is impossible to change. There is some poeple is not impossible for them to change the impressions.

If the poeple has the first impressions or the first feeling is almost impossible to change. Some poeple can change and some poeple can not change it. However, Some poeple think that the first impressions is head to change.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some poeple think is head to change the first impressions. But some poeple think that is essy to change the first impressions. An my experiences I think that is almost impossible to change the first impressions. Some poeple think that first impressions is when a person thought or feel about someone.',\n       b'We have all dreamed of owning a self driving car, and have heard about it once or twice. They may seem very cool and very far off in the future, but in fact, driverless cars may be the next big project the world will start to expand on. We all believe that there will come a day when none of the things we do now will be left to do in the future, but how well would the things do today be carried out in the future? I believe that future cars would be very ineffective, because of the cost of the process of putting the plan in motion, the problems that could occur while the cars are driving, and the amount of time it would take before we could make the cars legal.\\n\\nThroughout history, we have had great success in everything that has advanced in technology, like replacing hard labor with machines like tractors and cars. However, many of these products have been very expensive when we have tried perfecting the dream machine for technology. Cars vary from a large price range, and many of them that are new are not cheap. This could be a problem if we tried launching the driverless cars into action because of how much money it would take to build the right car. The car would have to first be made to be tested, which takes both time and money. Then they would have to gather up a whole bunch of money to start producing these types of cars, which everyone may or may not like. They would then have to take all of the cars from wherever they were made, and ship them to where they need to be. This would be very expensive, and may not even be liked by some people. Some people dont feel safe in a car, so why would they by one where they wouldn\\'t be in charge? These future cars would also come at a very high price, because the top leading car companies are the ones trying to make future cars come true, like\"Google\\'s modified Toyota Prius,\" and,\"BMW,\" which were talked about in the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming.\" This means cars will just keep getting more expensive, until eventually no one could pay the price, which would also be a drawback for the company, especially in materials, money, and time.\\n\\nNot only is cost an issue, but so is the technology itself. Most cars malfunction in all different sorts of ways. For example, locked breaks, oil leaks, and much more. This means that not all cars can be trusted and one hundered percent trustworthy. We are still trying to perfect the modern car used today, but there is always something that occurs that stops us in our tracks. Putting our lives on the line by letting a new and advanced car could be very dangerous, because the history of perfect cars is not clean at all. In the passage \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" there is a lot of talk about sensors and gadgets used to ensure saftey, but knowing about most technology, it would have some downfall, which would be very unsafe. For example, if \"antilock brakes and driver assistance\" failed, which they could potentially become a big hazard once they failed. In Drivers Ed, they tell you to limit as many hazards and distractions as possible, so that you can be assured safety while driving on the road. If you add more advancments to your car that could be a hazard at any given moment, you would add more problems later on that could become unsafe.\\n\\nThe last big problems future cars are subjected to face are making them legal. If it is very hard to make cars legal by testing them and spending money on them, then the chances are driverless cars would be way worse. They would have to be tested a lot more, and would definatley cost a lot of money. Some people wouldn\\'t even trust the car, because we as humans can\\'t even trust each other at certain points in time. In order for someone to trust the car, they would probably have to make it themselves. Even if they became legal, as soon as one major accident or malfunction with one of the cars happened, we would have to go back to square one, and gain everyones trust yet again, which is very hard to earn back. If someone puts your life at risk over their own, you wouldnt trust them right away after that, would you? Making it legal would be very hard to do, like stated in \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" because of the \"roadblocks,\" that, \"lie ahead for the autonomous car,\" and the amount of saftey that would be needed in each car that would have to be tested many different times.\\n\\nTechnology is very cool and facinating, but we all have to take a step back and ask ourselves if putting effort into it is worth the risk. Cars are far from being perfect, and not having any flaws, and driverless cars are way far from being perfect.\\n\\nIn order to actually happen, we would have to consider the cost and amount of time needed to make them work right, the problems with the technology in the car that one may encounter, and the possibility of making it leagal and gaining everyones trust in doing so. Future driverless cars aren\\'t that far away, but are also not that close either, because of the cost, time, problems, and making it legal that would have to be faced while making them.',\n       b'Dear senator, the way we elect this countries president is flawed and un-effective. We technically don\\'t directly vote for the president, we vote for some person who then chooses the president. Since this contry is democratic it think that the popular vote is definitly the way to elect the future presidents.\\n\\nTo start off,the electoral college isnt fair to voters because candidates only go to states where they know they will get the vote. In the article \"The indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the systemare wrong\" it says \"The electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in the states they know they have no chance at winning\". People vote for the person who they want to be in office not for someone who might vote for the person who you want. I guess you could say voters in swing states are going to know more about the election. But you never know that does not always happen.\\n\\nSecondly the eclectors could be anyone and could be chosen by anybody,there are no kind of qualifications. On the other hand the regular voters actuaully have to meet some sort of standards like you aren\\'t allowed to vote if you have commited some sort of crime a certain amount times. And most of the time the American people dont see adds or commercials about the electorates. Howdo we know we can trust these random people with our vote? In my eyes and probably most peoples eyes, see this system as a non-democratic way to vote for our president.\\n\\nTo conclude our country should switch to the popular vote system strictly because the elctoral college is an unfair, un-democratic way of choosing our nations future leader.',\n       b\"Even though the Electoral College is known as a disaster factor, it has its benefits. The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. Each candidate running in your state has his or her own group of electors that are voted for. When you vote on election day, which is held every four years on Tuesday after the first Monday in november, you vote for the candidate's electors. Many politicians wanted to abolish the Electoral College because of its lack of democratic pedigree, but the college doesn't allow voters of other regions to feel disenfranchised, it avoids runoff elections, and thinks that the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\nThe Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a transregional appeal. It would not be fair for a candidate to campaign heavily in a state that they know they are going to win. This does not gain them any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows will win. This causes voters that are from the opposite region to feel as if their votes did not count, that their new president would not care about their interests or values. The president would not really be their president because of the fact that they were ignored.\\n\\nVoters that are more likely to pay attention to the campaign by listening to each opposing sides that compete against one another should decide the election. If voters that voted didn't care and picked the weaker candidate, then everyone would pay the price. The knowledgable voters listen to the competing candidates and will receive the most information and attention from the candidates. This leads to a candidate worthy enough to become president, which will choose the country's decisions for the next four years.\\n\\nRunoff elections, where elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast is avoided. There is pressure for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast, which complicates the presidential election process, but is reduced by the Electoral College to announce a clear winner. The runoff election once happened to Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992.\\n\\nMany argue the fact that the Electoral College method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state. People knowing their vote will have no effect, will have less intentions of paying attention to the election then they would have if the president picked the popular vote. Voter's in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference and want the best for their country's future rather than people who think one vote may decide the election and disregard the point of voting.\",\n       b'The Facial Action Coding System is a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Using it for students in the classroom would be valuable. It\\'d be valuable because it would benefit students and recognizing others\\' emotions, benefit the students\\' feelings, and it\\'d help the way they\\'re educated.\\n\\nThe way the Facial Action Coding System would benefit students\\' is recognizing their emotions and facial expressions. It\\'d help the way they learn and what content is good in front of them. With certain material, all students interpret it in their own way. It would benefit how they feel about what is in front of them and what they\\'re learning.\\n\\nFACS would help others recognize emotions is because after using it and watching others, one would be educated on the technology and the way it works with humans. In the article it says that the system has up to 44 major face muscles working just like human muscles. One would learn how the new technology works after using it and it would improve how they read others themselves. \" \\'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,\\' observes Dr. Huang, \\'even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.\\' (like not smiling as broadly).\" WIth that being said from the article, it shows that basically all the same muscles are used to one general emotion and one could adapt that to their mind and be more educated about it.\\n\\nAlso, FACS would benefit students feeling stronger. D\\'Alto talks about drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky and how he has his actors \"carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy(feeling someone else\\'s emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person\\'s facial expressions.\" So after using the technology and practicing so much of feeling unknowingly, students would learn how to be emotionally healthy and how to balance their feelings.\\n\\nFACS would benefit the students\\' and the way they learn by practicing keeping them alert during their lessons and schoolwork online. After the right content being provided due to their feelings and emotions, it would become natural for them to stay focused. In the article, D\\'Alto explains how one\\'s feeling will trigger what is in the screen. He says, \" \\'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" Students would be provided the right material as they go about the lesson.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system would be very beneficial to student in a various amount of ways. The FACS would benefit students with recognizing emotions, benefit their feelings, and the students\\' education. FACS will better students and school systems.',\n       b\"Technology has been a really good source of information for the past years people find technology the best way to communicate, relax, plan, search stuff by using the internet. Ordering food online its a normal thing nowadays, people rarely go out to eat because of the food service, this is keeping humanity from doing any physical activity but its way easier to get something done. This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but that's also keeping them from playing outside.\\n\\nThere are a lot of problems in society now days one of them is ciber bullying, this can drive to many problems some people take it too seriously and that can start an argument,and some people can feel offended for other people opinions this can cause a big impact in those who are really sensitive in fact there are many cases when this drives them to commit suicide, for unlimited reason people get bullied everyday but its our decisions how you can take the respond. The best way to avoid ciber bullying is by not paying attention to whatever the other person has to say and walk away, focus on yourself and don't look back that's how life works.\\n\\nIn multiple situations kids enjoy watching something online than playing outside, but kids are not the only one who are being affected by this problems adults are also in the similar problem. My family orders food every night without going out of the house, and it's becoming a problem because theres no effort in that. By not doing any physical activity the body starts gaining weight and it can be critical if the person does nothing to stop it, by simply doing more outside activities people can get a better chance to experience more things in life as going to beach, play a sport that you haven't played before or going out shopping that's can be life changing for some people including my community.\\n\\nMobile devices are improving in a incredible speed in the past five years, nowadays it's way easier to find a place by using the GPS on a mobile device, this can also allow people from other countries to contact relatives from another country by making a simple phone call or a text. But this can be really expensive for some people a decent plan of data can cost up to fifty dollars per month, that's more money than it should be but somehow people are addicted to this. Phone updates can also help in many ways in your life Apple realized the group FaceTime not too long ago now up to four people can talk at the same time no matter where they live, this can help the plans for your future a bussnies project a wedding or a party this is life changing, this is the future.\",\n       b'Advantages of Limiting Car Usage\\n\\nLimiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, and this movement, known as \"smart planning\", has shown great potential in improving overall quality of life and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can become more compact, accessible, and environmentally friendly.\\n\\nOne of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a huge impediment to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint.\\n\\nAnother advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of overall air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been enforced to clear the air. During these bans, congestion has decreased significantly and the levels of smog have reduced. This not only improves the health and well-being of the residents but also creates a more pleasant and livable environment. By limiting car usage, cities can combat air pollution and create cleaner and healthier spaces for their inhabitants.\\n\\nLimiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. This has created a more relaxed and stress-free atmosphere, as residents no longer have to worry about the hassles of car ownership and the constant traffic congestion. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more compact communities with walkable streets and accessible public transportation. Stores are placed closer to residential areas, making it more convenient for people to access essential services without having to rely on cars. This can have a positive impact on local businesses and economies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities, limiting car usage can help combat climate change, promote healthier living, and create more vibrant and livable spaces. It is an essential step towards creating a sustainable future.',\n       b'The author really makes you feel as if exploring Venus could be safer than taking a trip to the movies. Obviously he points out also that it isn\\'t safe, it\\'s a huge risk that humans would have to take just to achieve knowledge about another planet.\\n\\nThe author first explains what Venus is, to prepare readers to further listen on what we would see on Venus. The author says Venus is \"Earth\\'s twin,\" and further supports this with \"it may have well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" \"It,\" reffering to Venus. The author states Venus has \"valleys, mountains, and craters.\" Telling the readers this information makes it seem as if seeing Venus would feel comfortable to us and nothing too out of the ordinary.\\n\\nAs ordinary as the author tries to make a trip to Venus seem he doesn\\'t end up leading us in the wrong direction, as he also states the dangers, \"humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" Reading that information makes it seem doubtful humans could ever explore Earth\\'s neighbor.\\n\\nThe author goes on to suggest ideas that NASA has pulling the reader back in to believe that it could be promising to think that one day humans can explore Venus. \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" That\\'s a lot to take in but the author makes it easy for us to understand the idea by comparing it to \"Jet airplanes traveling higher to fly over many storms.\"\\n\\nThe author wraps it up by saying \"Venus has value.\" He doesn\\'t go deep into the what \"value\\'s\" exploring Venus could have. Only thing he stats is \"insight,\" and \"human curiosity.\" The author not going deep into the values is exceptional because that\\'s not what the article was about. The article is more about just progress in space exploration, focusing on Venus. The author then wraps it up with a fair conclusion, including his main point that, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\"',\n       b\"March 2020/10\\n\\nGeneric_Name\\n\\nMs. Generic_Name\\n\\nPeople consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success have motivation to do new ideas even if they can not do it. They push them self to keep trying because it makes them stronger as a hum being. Being enthusiastic makes you confident, in want to do more thing's in life. people push them self on being enthusiastic, it makes them excited on being confident in them self. More you try the more you want to get interest in exploring.\\n\\nHaving enthusiasm makes you happy it only gives you have positive thoughts. There are great people in the world that will give you advice. Telling you that you can do it if you only put your heart into it you can get it. Even if you fail always keep trying, you most likely would not get it the first time. Seeing other people on their success makes you have enthusiasm and make you uncomplash your own dreams.\\n\\nNow in days their are people that expect if they try on doing something once they can not succeed again. Humans' relay on other's for their own achievement. Not having motivation makes you not want to do anything and you will keep failing. If you fail and fail, feel sad and give up you can become depressed. As you stop putting in effort in things you lose interest and do not try.\\n\\nFailure is what makes you strong so you do not give up on trying. Failing is what should push you to make improvement and know your strength. Tell yourself to always think positive never negative you should have enthusiasm because that is what makes you stronger. Who you are is how you make of it and having interest on new things makes you a believer in yourself. British Prime Minister Winston is whon showed people to not stop and believe in yourself when you are failing.

In some countries they don't have the food we do. The least we can do is help them get a boost. And some countries need animals so they can have food or transportation. It will give you a good experience. But if you get sea sick, ect. You are not fit for this job. Just think about if you were one of those people, no food, no animals,no transportation. You may think that you could be away from your family and it's a waste of time but think of it this way, there are other families out there just like you, hungry starving. Or could already be dead,lets not let that happen to any more families.\\n\\nThis is a one in a life time opportunity. You can save alot of lives from hunger. Afterwards once the animals are all unloaded you can have some fun. You can play baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling,games will make things seem quicker. You can also have a good feeling in your heart for helping others. Think about others, care about others.\",\n       b\"There are many different topics and reasons about becoming a Seagoing Cowboy but i'm not goning to mention them all if I did it would take me an excrutiateingly long time. So in cunclusion I am onley going to mention a few of them such as importance, adventure, and sites.\\n\\nThe importians of the Seagoing Cowboys was an extremley important person to be in that time period for saveing hundreds of thousands of cattle, hoarses and any kind of lifestock that was useful to the people. No matter how stormy it got they always tryed there best to keep on cource and never give up. They worked very hard cleaning stalls, feeding the animals, and giving them waterThey were always honored then and I think we should honor them now as well or better as they did back in the time of world war Two.\\n\\nOh and just imagian the adventure they had out on the open sea just having the time of there lives. They probably ran in to some nasty storms just think of the waves probabley huge waves the size of a mountain. In the story Luke almost whent flying off the shp but he got lucky he caught a peice of metal to hold onto. Cuold youjust imagian how much that would scare you, if you would have been swallowed by the hungery ocean. They could have even been flung overboard and eaten by sharks it just gives me the chilles thinking about it.\\n\\nOh just thnk of the sites they have seen they have probabley been all around the world. In the story it said that Luke he whent to Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. That was only one he even whent down the Panama Canal on his way to China! can you imagian dong somthing like that !? It would be spectaculer seeing those kind of sites. He even whent on a tour threw an excuvated castle now that is like the cherry on a sundae don't you agree?\\n\\nThat is why I think past Seabearing Cowboys shoul be honored for there services and not just ignored like they are today. My goal is to get the word out about the Seabearing Cowboys to show there importance to this country. So they arent just forgoten and cast away and not honored.\",\n       b\"Dear state senator,\\n\\nIn my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. I think we should keep the way we elect our presidents because it's a non-democrac way. It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. Our founding fathers compromised the Electoral system and since we can't get rid of our admendments and change the Constitution I don't tink we should get rid of the Electoral College system. It may be old, but new things aren't always the best things. I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals.\\n\\nAnother reason to keep the Elctoral system is because it's easy and effciant. If we just have the elction just be based off votes and not popular party it would be messy. The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.\\xc2\\xa0 Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones.\\n\\n270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.\",\n       b'Some people thinks that the face on mars was an alien. Actually, it was the natural landform that formed on mars. Although it may looked like an alien, Scientists figured that it was just another Martian Mesa. After the rumors kept spreading that the face was an alien, Global Survey spacecraft revealed the Face on Mars for what it really is.\\n\\nFirst of all, Mars Global Surveyer flew over Cydonia for the first time with Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera. They snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Then, they revealed that it was a natural landform, saying there was no alien monument after all. Since not everyone was satisfied, Mars Global Surveyer drew close enough for a second look. After that, they researched what the picture actually shows. As they looked, the picture was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which were landforms common around the American West. According to the picture, Mars Global surveyers figured that the face was just a natural landform.\\n\\nLastly, the above reasons and evidence shows that the face on Mars was just a natural landform. Furthermore, the face on Mars had played the most interesting role on Mars Global Surveyers, NASA, Scientists and us. Reason being, the fact that we all were curious about the face and had to figured out if the face was an alien or a natural landform. Therefore, the face on Mars was interesting.',\n       b'The claim as an imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even trying tot hide their emotions. Perhaps the new software developed improvements in perceiving emotions of others.\\n\\nIt explains within facial expression for each emotion. By using the software as they use to do tracks and making it 3D realistic, it can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutal face which meaning no show of emotion. As an example, imagine a computer that knows when you\\'re happy or sad, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen then a smiliar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. I know that its not true that if you make a confusion face in front of the computer screen it wont appear a confusion. Let\\'s say you make of your own, using the computer to make a 3D of a person face which it could be anybody, you control and how you feel into it, it\\'ll appear what you put in and it will show how you felt about it by loking of your final results on making the portrait.\\n\\nFor humans which they perform the same impressive \"calculation\" of how much emotions come into what you feel. As an example: you have a friend and you look upon their face, you wonder and can tell if their sad or happy. It\\'s way different as they say on software than in person as a human. You can automatically describe how the person feel is by looking and talking to them. It shows a lot and you can define if they are good or not.\\n\\nBy knowing the differences on defining facial expression each on software and as a human, they are two completely different things and how it can be solve too. As being explained how they calculated by using technology and making 3D Mona Lisa, showing emotion to it collecting your actions. By how you make it as weighting the different units. In human which person per person, you can define their feelings and talk about it. There\\'s no way you can hide away your feelings because sometimes you can sense it. It shows more out and can easily say what they feel than as software which is not believable or no comparasion.',\n       b\"My name is Luke Bomberger, and I just got back from an amazing trip from being a Seagoing Cowboy.\\n\\nI got to help animals recover from World War ll, and this trip was an amazing, and beautiful adventure.

The Electoral College has been used for many years and not been a problem til now. In my opinion, people are just getting upset because the nominees they voted for didn\\'t get elected.\\n\\n\"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner\". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It\\'s the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you\\'re actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don\\'t know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.\\n\\nThe Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules. They don\\'t know what they are talking about when it comes to political stuff. Therefore, you should not listen and keep the electoral college!\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME',\n       b\"Using Facial Action Codying System (FACS) to read students emotions could be a good thing. It could allow teachers, staff, and other students to know how a students is feeling. If you know they are feeling sad, you could change something to make them feel happy. These things could make the student more willing to learn and be more excited about school.\\n\\nIf you were to recognize how someone was feeling, think about how much that could benefit you and the person feeling that way. If you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely, you find out the problem and solve it. If a student was mad or upset, you could fix that too. This might create less violence in schools and higher school attendence rates. It could prevent fights and arguements between teachers and students. It could also prevent bullying. If a student is feeling sad, lonely, or depressed, teachers could recognize that and fix the problem before anything happened or got worse. This can also make school couselors better at their jobs and make their jobs easier. If couselor knew how you were feeling, they could get you the help you needed faster then when they had to figure out exactly how you were feeling.\\n\\nThe Facial Action Codying System (FACS) can be a good thing. It could solve so many problems inside and outside of schools. It can show when you're happy, surprised, disgusted, afraid, sad, and angry.\",\n       b'There are many advantages to limitng car usage aroung the world. When it comes to our economic problems cars are producing more and more pollution and destroying our O-Zone layer. Many diiferent countries are making differences by having car free cities where you only have few cars or none and creating a safer street for the people and cleaning up and repairing the sidewalks. Paris has a lot of Diesel fueled cars and the pollution got so bad they had to ban cars for a couple days to be able to clear the air because how bad the smog was getting and anyone who didnt listen to this rule was fined and if were caught driving had the opportunity to get their car impounded and towed away. The United States also have the same problems when you look at the statistics car usage is dropping in the U.S even though the population is growing. Even though this is benefitting the economy there is still a alot of pollution occcuring.\\n\\nSource A shows us that in this experimental area \"Vauban\" almost everyone has given up their cars to live in this suburban location. \"Vauban\\'s streets are completely car free\" according to author Elisabeth Rosenthal. She claims to have become a lot less stressful when she gave up her car to live in this area. She says that in Vabuan there is a lot less cramp and not much traffic at all because of the car free streets. Now everyone rides bikes around to get to places or even just walk, because of this the sidewalks were all repaired when the experiment was started and made everything presentable. Also when this experiment was completed in 2006 Businesses were opened just walking distances away from residents, so that people would be comfortable living in this town. Source A shows that private owned cars are choking cities because of all the fumes that are being created by cars and trucks and all motored vehicles. Passenger cars are responsible for more than half of all Greenhouse emissions in the Unitewd states, and since there is a lot of Greenhouse fumes being created the Enviromental Protection Agency in the U.S. is promoting car reduced communities. Yes, it is only one small way to change how the future of our world is going to be but it will make a change.\\n\\nIn Paris, France there was a temporary car ban because of how bad the situation was getting. A smog was created and covering all the skies and was a frightening view to see. So the government went on and created a ban with specific rules. On one day the Cars with even numbered license plates would not be allowed to be driven and on the next day it would be odd numbered license plates were the ones that weren\\'t allowed to be driven. If any person were to disobey this law and take the car out of their homes and caught by an official they would be fined and have the vehicle towed and impounded. Causing the person to have to spend more money and get the car back. This ban was eventually lifted as the skies cleared and everything went back to normal. Bogota has a car free day every year which is set to be a day where everyone walks aroung or ride bikes, skate, or hiked around everywhere all for the ecosystem to be able to recover at least for 24 hours. Because of this one day, bycicle lanes have been created and sidewalks have also been repaired. Making it a safe place for people to be able to get around. This is a very effective way of recovering the damage that was once done by the cars that our own people use.\\n\\nIn the United States studies show that all though the population is increasing car usage is dropping and not as many cars are being bought and used like before. studies also show that as every year passes less and less americans are getting licenses and buying cars. Some may say that it is because of the economic problems a lot of the Americans are going through with the money limitations or if it is just a personal choice. Either way car reduction means less pollution and it is all benefitting our planet. According to source 4 as of 2013 the number of miles driven per person is 9 percent below the peak which almost ties the amount of miles driven per person in 1995 when a lot less people were even alive.\\n\\nAll in all Car reduction programs and bans on cars on certain days all benefit the O-Zone layer and should be done annually to be able to help our ecosystem. This is a very effective method to use and I feel as if all of the world should adopt this ideology and use it as it has statistically shown effectiveness.',\n       b'Can you imagine a time in the future when your driving a driverless car with your family or just you. When all of a sudden it malfunctions leaving you and your family critically injured or even worse dead.\\n\\nEngineers have been working on perfecting driverless cars for many years. If we do get a completely driverless car, how much is that going to cost? Are they going to have to update the roads to keep up with the cars? Will everbody be able to afford this or just the rich? Were would all this money come from to pay for these roads, tax payers money. Putting all your trust and safety into technology and sensors to drive on their own, when anything can happen its not always 100% which could leave you or anyone else injured or dead.\\n\\nThe cars have these necessitates to alert the driver when its their turn to drive on situations required, but \" wouldn\\'t drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?\" specially if that person is drunk or high and had no idea what was going on. Their relying on the car to get home while they have no sense in the world, but if the car tells them to start driving and they don\\'t its just a accident waiting to happen. I believe these driverless cars give these reckless people to be even more reckless.\\n\\nSo can you really put all your trust or even imagine a future with driverless cars knowing its not 100% guarantee or knowing that reckless people could be behind the wheel and is endangering you and your family. The road to autonomous car can stop , we don\\'t need a car that can do everything we do by making assumptions.',\n       b\"Jonh once said, Technology had positive and negative effects on people's life, people complete many tasks without having contact with others. Some people said that technology is good because they can do many thinks, like find books, information and do works more easy. Other people thinks differents, they said that technology is bad because had negative effects on people life, if people do not know how to use it, they can will have problems because sometimes people send archivements or informations to the wrong person or publish it. I think that technology is bad because with technology we can do many thinks, but some people use technology for hacks, steal acounts and cheat persons.\\n\\nFirst, some people said that the technology is important in this era, because is more easy to do many thinks,\\n\\nfor example, search specific information more fast.\\n\\nTo do homeworks or company works with more information and explanations make projects, glide planes or to find books and work without think a lot.\\n\\nSecond,the technology is very important to some people, because many times they used it to do they works and make some project, the technology in this era provoked many wrong thinks, it created many electronic thinks that are advanced. Then, the purpose of use technology if for good reasons and with the technology always people will have easy infornation but they wil not learn the technology caused that people lose their time playing videos games and visiting wrongs wed site. However, the technology caused many problems, the people are using the electronic thinks a lot, the cellphone, video games etc. It are creating a obsession in the people, many kids and adolocents have problems with they vision, because pass a lot of time in the cell phone, computer or playing videos games causing cancer, tumor or lose their vision.\\n\\nFinally, the obsession that technology are creating is very worrying, many kids don't do the homeworks, the students text in class and do not put attention, other persons driving texting causing accidents. Some parents permit that they kids use technology, but they do not have the contol of them the adolecents use technology for have fun sometimes causing problems. Today in this era the technology are advancing and provoking that people do not learn and sometimes it cause the death, persons use technology sometimes to hacks acounts and steal informations, photos or they publish inappropriate photos in they acounts causing bullyng or making the person feels bad. Also, the technology is very advance that the people are creating robot to make more easy the works, but is is a ploblem because the robot will be remove the people jobs, causing that the people leaving whithout job.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the technology had negative effects on people's life, creating obsession on people and doing more easy the ability to do works,but for people tha use technology a lot need to have a limit, and if they have acounts with important information they need to protect it with a strong password, if they have kids and permit that use technology they need to control them what they do and put a limit how much can use the computer, cell phone or videos games. people have to put their own limit to control technology when it cause problems.\",\n       b\"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the president by popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give small states more influence, today's system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This undermines the principle of one person, one vote and democratic fairness. \\n\\nSupporters of keeping the Electoral College argue that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and avoid focusing just on a few high population states. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates concentrate campaigning and advertising in only a handful of swing states that could vote either way. With a popular vote, every vote would matter equally and candidates would need to appeal to a broader range of citizens. It would encourage higher voter turnout nationwide rather than selective turnout in swing states.\\n\\nIt is also argued that the Electoral College system maintains the federal character of the election by giving small states more say. But in practice, the national popular vote winner almost always wins the Electoral College too. So the system does not significantly boost small states' influence. Furthermore, allocating electoral votes based on congressional districts in some states has politicized the redistricting process and led to instances of partisan gerrymandering to benefit one party. \\n\\nA nationwide popular vote would be a simpler, more straightforward and democratic process. It would ensure that the candidate preferred by the most Americans would become president. While changing to the popular vote may need an amendment, moving in this direction could help address concerns about how some recent elections have undermined faith in our democratic system. For these reasons, I believe moving to a national popular vote is a better approach and ensures that every valid vote has an equal say in choosing the president.\",\n       b'People in America vote for a candidate running for president believing that their vote counts, but in reality it all comes down to the Electoral College. According to \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tot he kind we have now.\" We, as a country, need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states in order to have fair completion instead of the people of America voting for a potential president only to find out the vote was worth nothing.\\n\\nTo begin with, majority of the nation wants to abolish the Electoral Congress because it\\'s an unfair process. Bradford plumer states, \"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\" It should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors so they can vote for the president putting our nation\\'s future in danger. The Electoral College used to be the the right way of election but now it\\'s known as something from the past. Traditionally, the Electoral College was \"a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, paragraph 1, by the Office of the Federal Register\" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. But now, this process is \"outdated paragraph 14, Bradford Plumer\" and there needs to be election by popular vote.\\n\\nAnother key point, former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, agree with \"abolishing the electoral college paragraph 9, Bradford Plumer\" as do Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFLCIO, and the Gallup poll in 2000. Majority wants to get rid of the Electoral College in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. also, voters cant always control who their electors vote for. Bradford Plumer notes, \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.\" The Al Gore election is an example of the unfairness that the Electoral College is pursuing. Al Gore won the popular vote against George W. Bush nationwide, which means the people wanted Gore, but he did not recieve enough electoral votes to win the election.\\n\\nIn the Electoral College\\'s defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Posner, \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,\" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. Without the Electoral College, the president wouldn\\'t have \"transregional appeal paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner,\" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president so the Electoral College requires the \"transregional appeal.\" To conclude, our nation needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of election by the Electoral College because this process of election is unfair to the voters of this nation. Also, majority wins and the majority of the country wants to repeal the Electoral College then we should make a change. If we want this nation to be the strongest it can be then we need to make choices that will positively affect our country and the people of our country.',\n       b'Dear state senator, It is the utmost respect that I ask for the method for presidential election be changed from the electoral college to something more suitable for the opinion of the people. The electoral college is an unfair system to the people, it can allow for individuals to decide what to do with the votes, not by the people of the United States of America.\\n\\nRevising the electoral college system may seem like a bad idea but the good that could come of it overlies the bad. If the election of a president was based directly by the voters , then candidates could promise money to the people who vote for himher. There could also be other problems with direct democracy such as what would happen in the chance of a tie? Who would break the tie? And how would it be decided fairly. The electoral college shouldn\\'t be removed, but should definitely be revised.\\n\\nThe electoral college permits the power of the electoral votes to go to whoever the choose. The electoral college is unfair to voters due to the winnertakeall system, whichh causes candidates to focus only on states the are \"swing\" states. In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see candidates at all. The electoral college is an outofdate system and either needs to be replaced or revised.\\n\\nWhen running for president, the candidate has a group of electors. With each candidate having their own group of electors, it provides without having to visit each state to nget their vote. The only thing the president is required to do is to wait. In reality, the president doesn\\'t even need to campaign, since the electors in the college votes are what matter. So, the candidate could just bribe the electors for certain states and heshe has that states\\' vote.\\n\\nThe voters do not vote for the candidates, but vote for the slate of electors. The electors are picked at state conventions, the state party\\'s central committee and sometime the presidential candidates themselves. The biggest issue with the electoral college is the disaster factor. The disaster factor are the potential problems with the system, such as back in 1960 when segregationists in louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy.\\n\\nThe electoral college is an outdated way of elections. The electoral college puts the power into indivduals\\' hands not the people. It was created back before the education was nothing close to what it is now. Therefore, the method of voting on representitives who then vote for the presdient is obsolete.',\n       b'Cars are a normal form of transportation some might say, but in Vauban, Germany there is a car free town. \"Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this new experimental district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders\". Says paragraph two in the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", some people may find this scenrio strange but its actually becoming more common. Many countries all over the world are starting making either a \"car free day\" or on certain days, making people pay fines for driving.\\n\\nFirst, an example of a \"car free day\"\\xc2\\xa0 is in Paris, France. This city has typically more smog than other European capitals. \"Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found\". After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear air pollution of the global city\". Monday motorists with even number license plates were ordered to leave their car at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)\". The same would apply to odd number plates the following day\". The congestion went down sixty percent in the Capital of France, the smog cleared enough monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.\\n\\nSecondly, another example of a car free day is in Bogota, Colombia. \"Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on car-free day\". This day in Bogota has been celebrated for three years straight now, \"where cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of seven million\". The goal of this day is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Even when it rains on car free day in Bogota this doesn\\'t stop people from participating,\" says Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. A businessman says \"it\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car. One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state. If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog. We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.',\n       b'I believe that we, the people, should elect our presidents by popular vote. although all 48 presidents have been elected by Electoral College, I think its time for some change.\\n\\nIn the second source, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the bestlaid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumber, he states that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. These electors are just simply pledged to whom the voters vote for. The people have no control who their electors really vote for.\\n\\nNow others like in our third source, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" written by Richard A. Posner, believe that when we vote for that slate of electors, we can \"trust\" that they will vote for the president the people voted for. In my opinion, I urge you to ask yourself. Can you really trust these electors? How do we know they will vote for the president the people really want? How do we know they won\\'t ignore our votes? How can we trust these electors? Just like what Bradford Plumber said, \"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" To some, the electoral college is unfair because of the winnertakeall system in each state. Candidates usually only go to \"swing\" states. \"Swing\" sates are states with tight races. This, if fact, is not fair at all because some states don\\'t even get to see the candidates. In our second source, it clearly states that in he 2000 campaigns, 17 states didn\\'t see the candidates at all.\\n\\nIn the third source, it states, \"....Voters in tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaigns... They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters...\". I completely disagree with this because what mathematical, tangible, or hard core evidence is there to physically prove that the people in tossup sates are more thoughful that the people who aren\\'t. I think that candidates should go to states that have more people that are the opposite party.\\n\\nSo with this said, I think Electoral College should be no more and we should elect our presidents by popular vote. Thank you and have a wonderful day.',\n       b'There are many advantages in limiting the amount of car usage. Many people seem to believe that if you do not drive everywhere, you can preserve the land and it is proven to reduce stress. Another advantage would be that the government wouldn\\'t have to spend as much money on highways and other transport. There is a lot less congestion, and polution without the use of cars. These are all good examples of how reducing the use of cars could be very good for the environment.\\n\\nTo expand on the theory that a carfree cities are a lot better for the environment, we can say they preserve lands and cause stress levels to be reduced. In the first article, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\", Heidrun Walter is quoted explaining that he is \"much happier\" without a car in his life. He also states that when he did have a car, he was \"alway tense\". This seems to show stress levels going down, but that is only one example. In addition to stress levels, land preservation was also brought up. It is stated that without cars, roads and suburbs would be nicer and better for walking. Without cars, cities are also considered denser. Researchers are trying to conduct an experiment with a no car city and see how different and \"better\" life would be, to get more facts about it.\\n\\nNext, this carfree world could help save the government money. Studies show that in recent years, eighty percent of appropriations have gone to fixing and preserving highways for cars to continue driving on them safely. In addition to that eighty percent, twenty percent was provided for all the other ways for transportation, for example, buses. Without cars, we would be saving the government eighty percent of their money, holding on to the idea that areas would be kept in good shape without cars driving on them! Thats crazy!\\n\\nLastly, polution is a HUGE factor in this idea. Without cars, we would have a lot less polution and smog. In France, they have a few carfree cities and they states that without cars, sixty percent of smog levels went down in only 5 days! Fuel is blaimed for a lot of polution dailey and without cars, we could have a cleaner air and city in only a few days!\\n\\nIn conclusion, carfree cities could be a very good idea for some cities. We can make the air better, having less smog, spend less money, and have nicer land. These are only a few of the advantages to having a carless city.',\n       b'This paper will decride why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys.\\n\\nThere are many reasons .\\n\\nHere are some of them.\\n\\nOne reason is you get to help people that have no food or shelter because of a war.\\n\\nThey lost everything you take them food and biuld them shelter.\\n\\nAnother reason is that you get to meet people from other countries and explore there culture.\\n\\nYou go to China and Greece that is so fun.\\n\\nLastley a reason is that you get to stop at cool towns and countrys to get a tour.\\n\\nWe went to Crete and we went to the Panama Canal and went on a tour of that as well.\\n\\nThere are so many fun and entertaining things to do when you become a Seagoing Cowboy.\\n\\nSome reasons that you should not become a Seagoing Cowboy is because it is very dangerous.\\n\\nYou go into other lands not knowing if they aer going to be mean or very nice to you new comers.\\n\\nYou have to feed dangerous and vises animals on the ship such as hourses, goats, and donkeys.\\n\\nThey may not be happy about being on the ship and may get mad and hurt you.\\n\\nYou could fall overborad and be left to yourself in the ocean.\\n\\nThe ship may fall over and you may have a ship wreak.\\n\\nYou are going to paces that are danaged from the war and the soliders there might not know that the war is over and they could shot you.\\n\\nEven though there are many ways that you could get hurt or killed you will still have lots of fun on your trip across the world and back.\\n\\nAs you can see there are so many fun things to do on the ship and on the land.\\n\\nYou can play volleyball, baseball, wresteling, tag, hide and seek, and even vesing.\\n\\nYou will have fun on and off the ship and you will never be bored there are so many ways to be active and healthey even on the boat.\\n\\nThere are so many things to do off the ship like go and have a nice taste of what ever country or culture you are in, it is truly great.\\n\\nI hope that every thing I have told you will make you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy and mabey make that your dream job.\\n\\nThis paper explianed why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.\\n\\nJust think about all of the things I said today before you go pick your next job.\\n\\nMabey after that you will host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years with your family.',\n       b\"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI along with many other citizens have came to the conclusion that the Electoral College worth keeping. Though, the process itself has loose ends, overall it benefits the state and national election. The system uses general influence and a representative style of voting that makes the ballot more stable and dependable.\\n\\nAs a start, Electoral College electors are decided upon by the people. This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting.\\n\\nIn addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election.\\n\\nLastly, though people may not want to believe it, the Electoral College brings a certainty to the ballot that popular vote could not do alone. Having a presidential tie could be the messiest turn-out of an election, but with representative voting we can tip the scale in either way, in the interest of any state or party. It's a game of chance, but sure enough works better than flipping a coin! The Electoral College makes the voting system more reliable.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept as a part of the voting system because it gives a more concentrated form of voting, it only needs the same amount of trust betweencitizen and candidate as every other election style, and overall makes the voting system more reliable.\",\n       b\"The details in this article suggest that this article is presented well. The author talks about how Venus is very simaler to our planet Earth. He spoke about how dangerous Venus is and why it is dificult to go there. Then he spoke about how NASA will try to get there to continuer theyre reaserch. now how similar is Venus to our Earth.\\n\\nVenus, the second planet from our sun is some what extrordanary. Venus unlike any other planet in our solar system is very similar to our Earth, so similar its referd to as Earth twin. Venus has about the same mass as our Earth, the same density, and is similar in size. But, unlike Earth it is scorching hot. this poses a problem when our scientists at NASA try to study it.\\n\\nNASA or The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is trying to study Venus. NASA has sent numerous space crafts to Venus, but none of them made it. None of the space crafts could survive the hot 800 degree weather on the surface of Venus.

The day their parents hand them a key to their brand new car. We shouldn\\'t live off our cars, we should be able to go aywhere we want and not worried to see if you don\\'t have gas in your car, or if your license plate is expiered. My fellow citizens there is many advantages of limitig car usuage. Not being tense, not worried about the resposibilites on your car, and helps us to stop polluting the air.\\n\\nTo start, there are many places that don\\'t have cars and their life keeps on going they are even stressfree. For examle Vauban\\'s streets are completely \"car free.\" Heidrum Walter says \"when I had a car I was always tese. I\\'m much happier this way.\" (Source 1). Living without a car is not that bad. Living without a car can be much better for us. However the fact that living without car can be an advantage to us not everyone agress to the fact of it. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforeced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global cirty. Cogestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intesifying smog. Paris trypically has more smog than oter European capital. Delivery companies complained of lost reveue, while exceptios were made for plug in cars, hybrids, and cars carryig three or more passsengers. (Source 2). If the delivery companies and my fellow citizens can realize is that the cars that we so called center our development on is polluting our air causing smog in certain areas of the world, and you can see because Paris banned certain cars in its area the smog ended up going away. So instead of driving our cars everywhere we can use this to our advantages and limit our car usage, so we can prevet smog in our community and pollution in atmosphere.\\n\\nIn addition, gooig car less is a stress free zone. Business Carlos Arturo Plaza stated \"It\\'s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" Which is absolutly true in my view because in Bogota, Clombia a program that\\'s set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombias hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. (Source 3). The car free day in Bogota and how people walked, biked, skated, and etc shows a great way to to take away stress. While you are either walking, biking, and so forth you have the chance to clear your mind and at the same time your not in a car that can pollute the air which can\\'t result in smog. Also going car free is also becoming the new tread, a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, there has also been a large drop in the percetage of 16- to 39- year- olds getting a license. (source 4) I\\'m here today to show that this new tread that is spreadig is one that we should take to our advantage and use it, it\\'s making things better for us and also our communities.\\n\\nTo sum up, my fellow citizens we should limit our car usage. We all can enter this stree free zone together as one, we can help the place we all call our home. Don\\'t be against it and just use it to your advantage. Going car free is the right way to go.',\n       b'Why do scientists want to persue going to Venus? Is it the curiosity? Is it that they think they have found a possible substitute to Earth? In the article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author claims that even thoug it may be dangerous to do, visiting venus is a worthy persuit. The reasons that the author states in the article are: Astronomers are fascinated by the planet, human curiosity, and because NASA is already planning it.\\n\\nThe first reason why the author said that the mission to Venus should be looked at is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus. They are fascinated because they believe that Venus is the closes thing to Earth, not only by distance but also because they are very similar. In paragraph 4 it is stated that \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\". So they want to discover and see if Venus still has the Earth like qualities to it.\\n\\nFurthermore, the other reason the author gave as to why scientists are so interested in persuing the visiting to Venus is because humans are ery curious and because they think that the curiosity will lead to many things. On paragraph 8, the author explains that \"human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally untimidating endeavors\" meaning that might as well trying it since we are going to try far worse stuff in the future.\\n\\nLastly, NASA already is planning to send people to research Venus, of course, they are taking many precautions and they are simulating the things that astronauts might face when they get there or near there. \"NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow to float abov the fray\" as stated on paragraph 5, it would still be hot but they would be able to handle it. As they describe it \"Not easy conditions, but survuvable for humans\"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the author gave some strong points as to why they think that the studying of Venus should be persuaded. They also gave a lot of information and supporting details to their claims.',\n       b'During the 1700\\'s the world did not have transportation like we do now. They had to ride on horses and walk to where they needed to go. Now all we depend on is driving where we need to go. Its hurting our world and the people around who are around it. Their are plenty of advantages of limiting car usage around the world. Many people think its no good side to not driving around everywhere but their are. Stores are becoming closer to walking distance. It stops cars from poluting the world and it lessons stress from the human body.\\n\\nEverywhere you look you see a store or a building. We drive to places because we think its to far a walk or its a bad day to walk. In the Article \"In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars\"\\xc2\\xa0 it says that in Vauban,Germany they built stores that were a good walking distance on a main street instead on a long far away highway. So that means the stores are closer to you,which is good because you can go alot more often if they are closer and easy to get to. Another advantage to that is that its faster to walk if they bring the stores closer to you. This is some of the advantages to limiting car usage.\\n\\nCars are polluting our world everyday and everynight night somebody wants to drive. In the aritcle \"paris bans driving due to fog\" it says that Paris had to force people to leave their cars at home or they would have to pay a fine if they drive it. It says that it was intense smog. Cars cause alot of damage to the world but people who drive dont see how it\\'s effecting the world. The Smog caused alot of traffic to happen and that most likely caused car accidents to happen. Instead of driving if you walk it helps you not worry about gas prices or anything that you worry about that is related to driving so it relieves stress.\\n\\nAll in all limiting car driving is the way to go. It improves the walking distance to and from the stores. It helps the world from being polluted and relieves stress from your body. Why would\\'nt you want that for yourself and your family.',\n       b'The authour suggests that studying Venus is a worth pursit despite the dangers it presents. Even though its dangeruse the author still thinks its a good idea to go and study Venus.\\n\\nYou can tell the author belives this to be ok evon though its dangerous when he said,\" Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intemidating eneavors.\" This means that he knows its dangruse but everyone is curuose about what they will find, even if its dangerous he thinks its worth it. The opertunity to find signs of life or rare metals it would prove tempting for some even if it was dangrouse.\\n\\nIf you continue to read the passage he goes on to talk about how Venus is inhospitable. He then says he still wants to study it by saying, \"Astronomers are facinated by Venus beause it may well once have been the most earth like.\" This means they are trying to see if Venus had life just as earth dose now.\\n\\nIn conclusion the author thinks the pros of going to Venus out way the cons. Honestly I think he is right my self we could discover so much if only we knew what secrets Venus holds.',\n       b'Dear Senator...\\n\\nThe electoral college has recently been a very controversial topic in the world of politics. Many believe that it\\'s a significant system, that\\'s why the Founding Fathers created it, while others argue that it doesn\\'t necessarily work as well. The Electoral College is a process in which there is an agreement between the president\\'s election by a vote in Congress and the president\\'s election by a popular vote made by the citizens. There should be a change in the system into changing election by a popular vote since the Electoral College is not only an outdated system, but it gives the citizens no control over who Congress will be picking.\\n\\nTo start off, the process of the Electoral College should be changed since it\\'s an outdated system. As stated in \"In Defense of the Electoral College\" it says \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachroism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.\" Even the article that seems to be favoring the electoral college introduced it as so. It can be seen that it is a process that has been around since America itself, but America has constantly been changing and innovating and it needs a more flexible system to cast the votes. In \"What is the Electoral College\"? it states that \"THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS QA COMPROMISE\" HENCE THIS IS STATING THAT THE SYSTEM WAS CREATED A LONG TIME AGO AND IT NEEDS SOME CHANGES.\\n\\nTO CONTINUE, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED SINCE IT DOESN\\'T GIVE THE CITIZENS ALOT OF CONTROL AS TO WHO THE CONGRESS WILL BE PICKING. IN \"THE INDEFENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, IT SAYS THAT \\'THE SINGLE BEST ARGUMENT AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE DISASTER FACTOR.\" WHAT THIS IS, IS THAT THE VOTERS HAVE NO CONTROL WHOM THE ELECTORS VOTE FOR. AS WELL, IN THE SAME ARTICLE, IT STATES THAT \"AT THE MOST BASIC LEVEL, THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS UNFAIR TO VOTERS. BECAUSE OF THE WINNER TAKE ALL SYSTEM IN EACH STATE, CANDIDATES DON\\'T SPEND TIME IN STATES THEY KNOW THEY HAVE NO CHNACE OF WINNING.\" WHAT ALL THIS SAYS IS THAT, THE VOTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS PICKING, AND IT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER SYSTEM.\\n\\nTO CONCLUDE, THE ELECTORAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED TO A NEW SYSETM WHICH IS FAIR AND MORE TRUSTFUL TO THE VOTERS. NOT ONLY IS THE SYSTEM OUTDADE, BUT IT DOESN\\'T GIVE THE VOTERS ALOT OF CONTROL. A NEW SYSTEM SHOULD BE INTRODUCED. ALTHOUGH MANY AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE CHANGED, ALSO SOME BELIEVE IT SHOULD STAY HOW IT IS. THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ALTERED, SO THIS WAY, THE PEOPLE HAVE THE VOICE, NOT ONLY THE GOVERNMENT.',\n       b'Driverless cars is certainly an amzing idea. It has captured the ideas of filmakers and writers around the world. It is a great idea and should be pursued. The reason for this is because it would make the roads safer, and give people more free time.\\n\\nThe reason this is a great idea is because a driverless car would make the roads much safer. There would be very little room for human error. If all cars were driverless operating under the same systm then they would always be doing the same things, meaning they would never crash into each other. With new technological advances in society, we would be able to create new sensors that could locate the objects around them and drive on the road. The article already list a few of the advances in sensors that can lead to very safe cars.\\n\\nThis would also give people much more free time. You can do things on the internet within your car that you would not have been able to do otherwise, considering the idea from the article about the heads-up displays. Also if you had a systme driving your car for you, you could travel at much higher speeds. The car would never leave the road because of a jerk of a hand. They would run, completely safe at higher rates of speed, giving people more time to do the things that they need.\\n\\nThese are just two of many reasons why we should have driverless cars around the world. It would be a huge step in society and technology. We need driverless cars to make the roads safer and to give people more free time.',\n       b\"On May 24, 2001, about 25 years ago the NASA's viking spacecraft was circling the planet. It then spotted a human like face. It was huge! It was nearly two miles long. It looked like it had been staring back at the camera from where this picture had been taken.\\n\\nThe face is clearly a natural landform. When Mars Global flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin snapped a picture ten times sharper than the first photo. When this picture was taken it was a very cloudy day. This means that the camera had to peer through all the clouds to get this good of a picture. But skeptics say that the aliens images were hidden by the haze. That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform.\\n\\nThis is a great natural landform and it is very questionable at first, if this could really just be a natural landform. But knowing that the NASA has went out more than one time and taken pictures of this face really does show that it is not aliens. Not only have we taken pictures but we have proof. These are all the reasons why it is certain that this face is a natural landform.\",\n       b'\"The Cowboy Program\"\\n\\nThis isn\\'t just any type of cowboy program, this is a cowboy who rode the waves. I think it would be good for kids to come helpout at this program. It can make you smart and learn about things you might not know.\\n\\nThis boy named Luke went with his best friend. His life totally changed. I\\'m now going to tell you why you should come. What they did their was they helped people. The boy boys played fun games like, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling. They did that to help pass time.\\n\\nBeing a Seagoing Cowboy was much of an adventure. Now here are some places they went that I think you might like. It took the group two weeks to travel across the Alantic ocean. They went to China which took a month. Also the program went to Greece to get their Military service. For World War ll in 1945, they went to Europe.\\n\\nNow I\\'m going to tell you things they did to help out that you might like to do, if you like to do chores. Luke served as a night watchman. Also he went and checked on the animals every hour. Also to keep Luke busy about the animals is they had to be fed or watered two or three times a day. Another thing is bales of hay and bag of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. The stalls also had to be cleaned.\\n\\nLastly I\\'m going to tell you why Luke went on this ship and why you might want to. Luke went on this trip because he wanted to help out is best friend. Also he knew it was possibly the only chance he would ever get to get to go. Another reason is Luke thought it might be good work him. I think he also went on this trip to help out 44 other countries to recover their items. This was a very important job and Luke did a good job. I bet if you tried this, you would too.\\n\\nDo you think you would ever want to go on this trip? I would, it sounds like you have to do work, but you still can have a lot of fun with the trip. I think it is also important to help out with other things. Maybe some day you should try this some day if you ever get the opportunity.',\n       b'The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency.\\n\\nAdmmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deviding the votes. In the first article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, \"Most states have a \\'winner-take-all\\' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a \"swing\" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a \"winner-take-all\" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, \"Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate\\'s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for. However; the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the elecoral college is outdated and must be eliminated.\\n\\nTo start off, Bradford Plumer the author of \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" states, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Every vote counts. But why make a vote more powerful than another. Citizens shouldn\\'t be given a special vote just because they were chosen by the candidates party. Additionally, Plumer explains, \"If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you\\'d vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.\\n\\nSecondly, Plumer claims \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters.\" This method is rediculous. A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. Also Plumer adds, \"Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency.\" This means more people thought he was better suited to be the President of the United States, but Bush won because of the \"quirks\" of the electoral college. All in all, the electoral college is unfair, and creates more problems then popular vote.\\n\\nThe United States of america should change from the electoral college to popular vote. The outcome would be better for the country, and fairer to the candidates. That is why the electoral college should be eliminated.',\n       b'Based on my experiences i would say that is not true because people always can change.\\n\\nIm my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them.\\n\\nThe first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change.\\n\\nOne reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment.\\n\\nIf i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend.\\n\\nThe first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer.\\n\\nTo conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.',\n       b'Dear State Senate,\\n\\nI feel that the way we, the people, vote today is very unfair. We should change the voting to popular vote for the president of the United States. The majority of people don\\'t care about voting for the next United States prsident because they don\\'t get to chose who will win. The people that get to vote for one\\'s state might not think about what what the remaining others would want.\\n\\nIn source one, this section tells the reader what an electoral college is and how it works. Paragraph two sums up what this system is, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting if the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically what this paragraph was saying is that the people dont get to directly say who they want as president. The people of a state get to vote for who they want, but it is ultimately up to the state electors on who will get the vote from that particular state. There could be a ton of people voting for one president, and then there might be less votes for a president who may be even better. Ultimately what this system comes down to is the people don\\'t vote for their next president. They are selecting a name that might not do anything to their country.\\n\\nSource two talks about the electoral college and how the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In paragraph nine,\\xc2\\xa0 the text says, \"... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters\\xc2\\xa0 would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \\'swing\\' states.\\n\\nParagrapgh twenty-three, \"It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state- Democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.\" If these people were to vote by the system we have now, their vote would have no effect. This leads to the people living in these states to not vote. They don\\'t even pay attention to the campaign anymore. They know that they won\\'t do anything to the votes or who will become president. They couldn\\'t care less.\\n\\nWe should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.',\n       b\"I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college because of the fact that if the popular vote and the vote in congress were to fail, there would be a backup way of casting, counting and recording votes by a qualified group of citizens, as stated in the first paragraph of the prompt. I believe the Electoral College should not be abolished also, for the reason that each candidate for president has an amount of electors chosen, varying on the state laws in effect in the given state he or she is being elected from. Also, an advantage of the Electoral College is also that the winning presidential candidate is awarded all of the electors in most states, except Maine and Nebraska, stated in the seventh paragraph.\\n\\nThe College also identifies which electors will represent your state at the meeting of electors, as well as the presidential candidate. Just like almost anything, the Electoral College has flaws, such as electors can be any person not holding public office, and, depending on the state, whoever selects electors may vary. Plus, not everyone can control who their electors vote for, but the Electoral College has been in effect for over 200 years, established by the founding fathers themselves in the Constitution, so why not trust that they knew what they were doing? Besides, when each party selects a slate of electors, they put their trust, which, might I add, is rarely betrayed. But there is the problem that not all winners of electoral votes will not win the national vote such an instance happened in 2000, when Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. Even so, that was the first time since 1888, as said in paragraph 16.\\n\\nThere are a few practical reasons the Electoral College, even though it lacks a democratic pedigree, should be retained. Reason one is a certainty of outcome. An example is in the 2012 election, when Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral votes, while rodney recieved 51.3 percent of popular votes. A tie, is also possible, seeing as the total number of votes, 538, is even. Another example is how the electoral college restores some of the weight in political balance, in which large states, populationwise, lose by virtue of the malapportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The subject of the Electoral Coolege's method of selecting a president is controversial in the sense that it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, such as Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California,when they know their vote will have no effect, their incentive is much less than if it were picked by popular vote.\",\n       b'The advantages of limiting car usage are,street parking and driveways are now. car ownership only alloowed two places to park and that\\xc2\\xa0 large garages at the egde of the development where the car owner can buy space. Without that you wont be able to park anywhere\\xc2\\xa0 you would be better off walking or riding a bicycle.\\n\\nThere been efforts to make cities better for walking home and to other places. some countries developed increase of numbers of private cars owned and are being used with private parking spaces. It is a huge effect of reducing greenhouse gas if theres not lots of driving 50 percent of some car intensive area are effected. they are starting car reduced communities and legislator just for cautious to limit greenhouse gas from going out.\\n\\nMany experts\\xc2\\xa0 expect public transportation serving to play a big role in the new limiting car usuage. They made the motorist leave there cars at home or suffer a big fine. They did care even if you have a license plate or a odd number plate. They also limited car usuage because france uses diesel fuel\\xc2\\xa0 and that was a big impact in western europe.\\n\\nA car free day was made buses or taxes were the only cars permitted. They used those to ride to work or any other alternative to reduce smog. That was the best opportunity to clear air pollution. Many people from other countries came to see and celebrate the event that was happening. So many bicycle paths were made just because there were no more car usuage that was the most in any amercican city.\\n\\nSidewalks were replaced by even better smoother sidewalks even a rush hour started to happen now that the car usuage was limited. That dramatically cut traffic for taxes and any other vehicle that was still in usage. Some people feel more connected over the internet now instead of using there car to go see them all these changes made it\\xc2\\xa0 hard to continue the habit of not driving.\\n\\nSince the cars were out of usage a bike shaing program started and really increased the population that has been dropped because of all the cars not in use. If you were around the age sixteen and thirty nine you could get your lisence and start to drive again.',\n       b'\"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" There are 538 electors in the Electoral College. In order for a candidate to become President, a majority of 270 votes is required. I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainity of outcome and becouse of the states.\\n\\nFirst, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of the outcome. Because of the number of electors is even means that there could be tie. But, people don\\'t understand that is very unlikely. As said in Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it\\'s less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.\" So, most of the things that people stress over about the Electoral College are very unlikely to hsppen.\\n\\nSecondly, I am in favor of the Electoral College because of the states. Two types of states are big states and swing states. Big states are the states that have the largest population that \"the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance\" on. One of the other types of states are the swing states. Swing states use the winner-take-all method. Swing states don\\'t vote for the President based on his or her political party. They vote for the President based on who they are or who they like better out of the candidates so you never really can know who they are going to vote for.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am in Favor of the Electoral College because of the certainty of outcome and because of the states. The Electoral College have sources to rely on so that it won\\'t fail. Most people just don\\'t realize it because there has been a couple problems with the Electoral College before but, the Electoral College is a good system to have.',\n       b'This essay will include the reasons why people need to challenge exploring Venus. The text states that it will be good to meet the very edges of imagination and invoation to find out if Venus is really real. The author also says that people should be brave to explore on pass the earth and be more open to it.\\n\\nVenus would be dangerous to explore, because of it 97% carbon dioxcide. They say that the tempperatures average above 800 degrees on Venus. The pressure is 90 times greater tha what we experience on our planet earth. NASA states that they want to send our human kind to study the planet Venus.\\n\\nThere will be like 30 blimp-like vehicles hovering around the planet Venus. The tempertureswill still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahernheit. NASA is working on other approches right now to explore Venus. These are some of the ways that they are going to try and learn moe about Venus and other planets.',\n       b\"I stand behind the development of driveless cars. I think they could be a great improvement to transportation and commute.\\n\\nAs Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions in the article, there could be a public transportation system composed of driveless taxis that I think would be greatly beneficial as transportation. They would conserve fuel, which is good for the environment, and offer more flexibility for people who need to commute. Plus, if this system is made true as a public transportation system, it might reduce spending for people who use it and normally might spend more paying for fuel for their car, and/or car maintenance. People spend a lot on making sure their cars are working fine; with driveless taxis as a mode of transportation, you wouldn't have to worry about mechanic and/or fuel costs. A driveless taxi system could be dependable enought that you wouldn't even have to learn to drive or get a car, which could save you not only the cost of a car, but also time.\\n\\nDriveless cars could also reduce accidents. Currently, they're only programmed mainly to assist, and do basic driving, letting a human cut in when there are road or traffic issues and accidents. But, if one day, driveless cars were to be the main mode of transportation, and there were enough of them in circulation within an area, they could reduce accidents in that area with their smart-driving programming. Just assisting, as they mainly do now, is still a great improvement\\n\\n- they're programmed to drive safely and smartly, and likely would not be the cause or part of an accident. Current traffic laws assume that the only safe cars have human drivers, but I think driveless cars could be entrusted with keeping safety standards for these reasons. After all, it's humans that cause accidents - I don't think driveless cars could be programmed to be so reckless.\\n\\nDriveless cars are a great innovation. They would be useful and beneficial to so many people, and could reduce many risks that are issues with human driving today.\",\n       b\"Dear Mr. Senator,\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a unfair system used for voting the reprentative of our nation. Bigger states with a bigger population get more votes, and smaller states get less votes. Its not completely fair, but then again when is politics fair? If the majority of big states are all a certain paty (either democrst or republican) them the entire system is thrown off, unfair, and unbalanced. Its much more fair if the people of the United States vote amd the votes were to be counted as individuals and not grouped to see which has the greater percentage and then given a certain number of votes to that party's candidate.\\n\\nAlthough the process I think will be fair does include greater numbers, the government has equipment such as computers to do the counting for each person. This system is rigged and unjust. It is the opposite of what America and its foundation is all about - equality. I would like yout to take this to washington and even if you get scrutinized and pestered, you should ride forth because lots of Americans think this system is corrupt and if we want our voices and opinions to be heard there is no one else we can tell but you.

The author supports this idea by providing some information about Venus and how similer and different it is compared to Earth. In paragraph one, the author states how Venus is the second planet from our sun. Then in paragraph two, the author tells us that Venus is often referred to as Earth\\xc2\\x92s \\xc2\\x93twin.\" The author also states how Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density, size, and distance. Since Venus is right around the corner, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.\\n\\nIn paragraph two, it states that each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, because no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The author then stated, that maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has landed on Venus for more than three decades. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets it. The more challenging thing is that Venus has clouds that are highly corrosive sul',\n       b\"I would pick policy 1 because lunch is free time to eat talk to your friends and to use the restroom.

So when your in class no phones when your out of class you can text make a phone call take pictures of friends. Who wants to pass i know i do because i want to get a good job because if you don.t pass your classes then you can't get a good job.\",\n       b'Only topic that is frequenthy is debate today is whether or not conserve energy and resouces since some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some peolpe think that not only extending the school day should conserve energy and resource. They feel that is the same thing and also too that is more time in the school in addiction that they will spent more money in energy like electricity, ligths , charge to computers ,blackboard electric and the more things, an resource that should spent more is the water because some students when go to the bathroom they forget closed the washstand. I believe that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because should be take care about of how to conserve energy, resources and the last but not the least is we will have more time for make a the world better and take consience.\\n\\nOne reason i believe why that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours is because we can conserve more energy for the future, and also too the school should instruct to each student to be careful about the how to consume energy, for example to teach wich focus is the correct for the use in the home and gives tips for that maybe they to pay the least possible bill of light.\\n\\nAnother reason is that i feel that a resource that we can save in the school is the water because all students use almost two time the bathroom and always to take down the pull of the toile, i think the students can make posters in where show the importance about how to save the water and others resources that in the school can save is the plastic and paper because in some places purchase this resources, and with the money the school should to be a better school than others and the students should be more careful about this rescources.\\n\\nThe final reason is that i believe if the school add two hours at the day students and teachers should will have more time for to do more thigs, a thing that the teachers and students will can do is maybe a propaganda, in this propaganda they can show the society how prevent the clime global and to instruct how to be careful with of world, other thing that the students can do is a page online in where to instruct the other students and people out school how make herself have to be careful.\\n\\nAs you have read i think that the school should add two hours per day becuase all peolpe in the school can have more conscience for to save the energy and resource the last but not the leas the world. Only when we take consience for change the world. Will we have a better world on day.',\n       b'Voting has always been something special for almost everyone. From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenthcentury also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an onesided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral college. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.\\n\\nTo begin with, even though the Electoral College is criticized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples voices to be heard and expressed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will almost always guarantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated \"Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoralvote victory in that state.\" Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people\\'s voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.\\n\\nFurthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as rodney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diverse in the country to be able to spread hierarchical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that \"a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.\\n\\nLastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissolves the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a runoff election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is undemocratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples voices to be heard and expressed, requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissolves the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.',\n       b'I agree with the adoption about the midnight weekend however this did not mean that i agree the 10 p. m weekday curfew.\\n\\nAlthough many of the teenagers are constantly restricted nevertheless, the teenagers more younger`s that 18 has their own`s responsibilities and obligations to themselves and for their families because, the teenager`s need education, a home and money.\\n\\nThe teenager`s need education, being from elementary until high school grades. In 5 or 10 years in the future the teenager been the support from the economy, the country and the next generation.\\n\\nA home the teenager`s need a place to call \"home\" that place where him not only can relax, rather he should be tranquil and save from the rest of the world; that place where you know that someone is to waiting for you with a smile and food, sure will be you should reprimand but you know that is for your well-being and future.\\n\\nLogically the money is the more important fact in the teenagers life, to won it is necessary to get a part-time job or work in the weekend, that is where is the problem to obtain money the teenager`s from 16 to 18 year`s has to use their value time after school to work. The part-times are approximate 6 hours; if a student work from 4. pm to 9p. m there is no problem, but if a student work between the curfew from 5p. m to 10p. m the big problem is that the teenagers will been accused be breaking the law when it did not happen is just a unfairly interference from the city.\\n\\nIn summary: The children`s from today will be the teenager of tomorrow and the adults from the new generation.\\n\\na home is the best place to a teenager to feel comfortable, save and tranquil. The money is the most important think for a teenager in the present and for their future and the time is a necessary value to get it.',\n       b'I believe that the use of the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom or the community around us. This technology would help show how others are feeling when they are hiding their emotions. This would help because since the Facial Action Coding System is pretty accurate, we are able to use this in future generations to specify emotions from other people and know how they are feeling to help those around us in the world.\\n\\nWhen people are sad, mad, or even fearful, we can help those around us who are feeling down and comfort them. We can bring joy in the world by the people who are enjoying life and be with those who are happy by bringing those who are sad, mad, and fearful into the \"happy\" environment so they don\\'t have to worry. Studies show in this article that, \"\\'Most of us have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys... specific emotion.\\' and also, \\'Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,\\' Dr. Huang predicts.\" This proves that since not many of us in this world knows what our expressions are to see our specific emotion, especially during nonverbal communication, it would be best to see what their real emotions are and know what they are going through (or if they\\'re just fine) and ask if they want help or need comfort. We could help out others who are going through things even if they don\\'t need help. If they don\\'t want to be comforted, we can always respect their privacy. But it would be best to know what others go through to respect those around us more often. We shouldn\\'t offend and judge people in general because we don\\'t know what others go through and how they feel when we do judge and offend them. It would be kind and respectful to help those out around us to make the world a better place.\\n\\nThis system would help to read emotional expressions in a classroom because it would help the learning environment and the students in the class when the teachers are teaching. This would especially help the teachers more because teachers have trouble knowing what students are going through and can help their students out during class if they need help when they are troubled in their subject of math, science, English, ect. Most of the time, students don\\'t want to let the teachers know if they\\'re worried about an assignment or sad about their grade and don\\'t want to get help from the teachers. If teachers knew their students emotions, they would have a better interaction and communication with their students and help them learn better in class, understanding the subject more. Studies show in this article that, \"\\'A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\\' Dr. Huang predicts. \\'Then it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor.\"\\' This proves that since teachers want their students to be successful in their subjects, this system could help students and especially teachers to know when to help each other out when they are confused on a specific part in the subject and have a better understanding in the subject when the teachers do help out the students. This could also help because when a student is going through something and is distraced in class, the teacher would know their emotion and take it easy on them during class and help out the student with their problem and what they go through to have a better understanding and interaction with the student.\\n\\nIn conclusion, The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom and the community around us to help those around us in the world and get a better understanding of people and their emotions to make the world a better place to live in by comforting others who need help and showing kindness.',\n       b\"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my support for changing from the Electoral College system to a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. While the Electoral College was established by the founders with the aim of creating a buffer between the population and the selection of the president, in the modern era it no longer seems to serve this purpose effectively and can undermine principles of democracy.  \\n\\nOne of the main arguments against a popular vote is that it could result in candidates only focusing on population centers. However, the Electoral College system today already incentives candidates to focus campaign efforts and promises on a handful of swing states. According to Federal Election Commission data, presidential candidates spent over 95% of campaign visits and ad money in just six states in 2016. A popular vote could actually encourage candidates to build broader coalitions by appealing to a wider range of ideological beliefs. It may also increase voter turnout nationally as more citizens, regardless of state, will feel their votes directly impact the outcome.\\n\\nIt is also argued that the Electoral College helps provide a definitive outcome. However, we have seen close national popular vote victories not result in Electoral College victories, as with Al Gore in 2000 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. This undermines the legitimacy of the election in the eyes of millions who voted opposed to the outcome. A popular vote that aligns with the national preference could strengthen our democratic process. While concerns over sparsely populated states must be addressed, the needs and voices of all Americans could still be respected through the Senate representation. \\n\\nIn conclusion, while the Electoral College may have served purposes in the past, in today's highly polarized political climate it can discourage national consensus building and participation. I believe changing to a popular vote system would make our democratic process more equitable and respected at home and abroad. This is an important issue, and I hope you will consider supporting a popular vote reform to help modernize how we elect the leader of our country.\\n\\nThank you for your consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your name]\",\n       b'The advantages of limiting car usage are becoming more apparent in many parts of the world. One example is Vauban, a suburb in Germany where car ownership is discouraged. In this community, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent of residents actually sold their cars to move there. According to one resident, life without a car has reduced stress and made them happier. This suburban experiment demonstrates the potential benefits of separating suburban life from auto use.\\n\\nThe trend of separating suburbs from car usage is not limited to Germany. It is also being adopted in other parts of Europe, the United States, and the developing world. Planners are aiming to make suburbs more compact and accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. Stores are being placed within walking distance, rather than in distant malls. Transportation for America, a coalition of hundreds of groups in the United States, is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. This shift in planning is necessary, as passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\nThe advantages of limiting car usage are not only environmental, but also social and economic. In Paris, a partial driving ban was enforced to clear the air of smog. Congestion in the city decreased by 60 percent, and the smog levels were comparable to those in Beijing, one of the most polluted cities in the world. Delivery companies did suffer some financial losses due to the driving ban, but exceptions were made for specific types of vehicles, such as plug-in cars and hybrids. Public transit was also made free of charge during this period. This example shows that limiting car usage can significantly improve air quality and reduce congestion in cities.\\n\\nFurthermore, limiting car usage can have a positive impact on the quality of life in cities. In Bogota, Colombia, a car-free day was implemented to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. The program has spread to other countries, and there has been a significant decrease in traffic congestion during the car-free day. The event has also led to the construction of more bicycle paths and parks, improved sidewalks, and the development of new restaurants and shopping districts. This demonstrates that limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more livable cities with better infrastructure and amenities.\\n\\nThere are several factors contributing to the decrease in car usage. One major factor is the shift in behavior among Americans. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and has been steadily decreasing since then. This decrease in driving has environmental benefits, as transportation is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also leading to changes in the car industry, with companies like Ford and Mercedes rebranding themselves as \"mobility\" companies with a broader product range. This shift in behavior is attributed to various factors, including the rise of telecommuting, the renewal of city centers, the availability of car-pooling apps, and the proliferation of car-sharing programs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages. It can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, decrease congestion, and create more livable cities. The shift towards limiting car usage is not limited to one country but is a global trend. It is important for policymakers, urban planners, and individuals to recognize the benefits of reducing car usage and work towards creating more sustainable and accessible communities.',\n       b'Reducing the Usage of Cars\\n\\nThousands of Americans use their own car or a vehichle as their main transportation in their every day lives. No one seems to look at how cars are actually destroying the environment ,rather then helping it. Mainly since the fuel that is given off from a vehicles engine is effecting the environment in a negative way. In all reality the reason why we as humans use our own vehicles is because its a faster way of transportation and carries us to our destination. This is\\xc2\\xa0 why limiting car useage will be benificial money wise and create a healthier environment.\\n\\nReducing the car usage is beneficial to creating a cleaner and safer environment. Not only will this effect the environment but your\\xc2\\xa0 life as well. According to source 1 it states,\" Passengers cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmision in Europe.\" Based on this fact I can acknowledge the fact of how automobiles can effect the greenhouse. The greenhouse is a cycle\\xc2\\xa0 in which can have a huge impact on our environment. If we destroy that then that may result in even more damages that are caused now. It also states, \"Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France , after five- days of intesifying\\xc2\\xa0 smog...\" In result, the smog then continued to places such as Bejing, China. Which I personally would consider to be\\xc2\\xa0 a\\xc2\\xa0 horrfic thing, considering China is very congested already and is one of\\xc2\\xa0 the most\\xc2\\xa0 pollued cities in the world. Some may argue of the fact that car usage is their main way from going to point A to point B , but there is proof that is effecting the cities around us. Experts have concluded that there is about 50 percent car intensive areas located in the United States. This is why car usage should be reduced to have create a better environment.\\n\\nThe suburbs are taking action to create denser cities. The purpose of having denser citiies is to have a low- suburban life. In source 1 it states, \" In this new approach , stores are placed a walk away, on main street, rather\\xc2\\xa0 than in malls along some distant highways.\" This experiment will help to encourage more ways to attempt public transportation. For instance, riding your bicycle once in a blue moon. Not only are you saving money but you are preventing less traffic fgrom occuring in your area. Some may argue having a low- suburban life can be hard to adapt to but it will provide a safer environment. Especially since you are one\\xc2\\xa0 step\\xc2\\xa0 closer to making the world less polluted then it already is. I personally would agree on occasionally using a different way to get to my destination. It will not only benefit me in the long run but also cause less chaos on the road. It also states in the text,\" the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting car \"reduced communties\", and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.\" This means that the Environmental Agency are starting to promote reducing car in certain communities. Some may argue why is there a need to reduce the amount of cars in a community ,but on the other hand that community may be over populated or congested of cars. If this is so, then this will just have another negative impact of the environment. The purpose of the program is\\xc2\\xa0 to benefit the area you are and to lessen then the issue of car usages. All in all, the suburbs are taking action to create denser cities.\\n\\nPrograms are also being created to spread the news of Car- Free day. The purpose for Care - Free day in Bogota , Columbia is a day you participate in to prevent traffic jams. For example, In source 3 it states, \"..millions of Colombians hiked, biked, and skated or took buses to\\xc2\\xa0 work during a car- free day.\" This day isn\\'t ment for people who live in Bogota, Colombia but they are trying to influence this tradition in several other countires. Other may agree of this day being pointless , but I can see this having a huge impact on the world . Sooner or later this day will become a tradition not only in several other countries but also in the United States. it also states in source 3,\" Its a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pulltion, said a bussniessman.\" Especially since it rained on the Car- free day this didnt stop nor discourage anyone from participating in the event. The event turned out to be a huge success and reduced the amount of smog that day. In my perspective we are all come together as one to build our community together. It takes more thenone person to have such a huge impact on the world. The goal if to lessen the useage of car to have a positive effect on the environment. The influence of the Car- free day is just one step closer to reaching that goal. This will is why programs are being creates to spread the news of Car - free day.\\n\\nAfter looking of the causes and effects of limiting car usage , it all comes down to having a big influence on the world. It takes one area such as Bogota, Columbia to have a huge impact. In our every day lives , our car is our main resource for transportation, but this should change. Not only are you capable of helping to have a postive effect on the environment but so am I. This just shows how if we are all willing to come together as a\\xc2\\xa0 community, we are capable of creating a healthier environment. This is why the world should influence limiting car useage.',\n       b'Dear Senator of Florida,\\n\\nWhat is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the \"Winner-Take-All\" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?\\n\\nTheir has been many mishappens because of the Electoral College. For example, from an excerpt called \"The Idefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong\" says \"The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disastor factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worst.\" This shows that the electoral college does do damage to the United States because they let a huge crisis happen during the elections. They could have let it get even worst because they allow it to and make it easy to make things worst in certain crisis.\\n\\nI feel like you should give the people more of a say because half of the people that vote problably don\\'t even know that they are not actually voting for the president. They probably vote thinking that they are voting for the president not for the electoral college to see who will end up on the board. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters. Voters pay to vote, to what pay the Electoral College to vote and make their say so important it is sad. The reason it is sad is because all kids want to do when their younger is vote because they feel like it symbolizes them growing up and like they get a real say in who the next president is or the senate anything just as longs as they get a say. But truthful their not getting a say in who will be the next senate, treasurer, or president their actually picking the board who will be picking for them.\\n\\nEven the People once wanted to abolish the Electoral College. These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong.\" is sates \"They\\'re not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It also states that \"This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidancy.\" This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out.\\n\\nSo really thier is no need for the Electoral College because all they do is make the competion unfair for the other person going for the election. Also, because they have cause or been a part of problems and mishappens. In an article it mentions \"Perhaps moat worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, were staes delegation vote on president.\" Also, when you are voting for the Vice-President you are not actually voting the senat picks who the Vice-President is. The Electoral College is overall unfair to the voters and the people running in the election.',\n       b\"Dear Senaitor, I feel ithait ithe elecitoral college should be be removed from ithe voiting process and replaced by ithe popular voite.

Even ithose who oppose ithis view agree ithait ithe Elecitoral college is a nondemocraitic sysitem. Doesnbit ithait seem like an issue considering ithis naition was founded on Demorcraitic beliefs?\\n\\nI undersitand ithait some feel iit's ok if ithe ithe voiting is lefit mainly ito itoss up sitaites because ithey seem ito be ithe ithe people who are more ithoughitful abouit ithe lecition. The only reason ithis is ithe case is because ithe canidaites spend itheir whole itime in ithe swing sitaites and ithey compleitely alienaite ithe oither sitaites. In facit, in 2000, seveniteen sitaites were compleitely skipped over by canidaites. This causes people ito feel discouraged from voiting because ithey feel as if itheir voites are unimporitanit or ithait ithey don'it know enough ito casit an educaited voite.\\n\\nAlso people like ito argue ithait ithere is no problem wiith ithe elecitors because ithey can always be itrusited.

Someitimes elecitors flait ouit refuse ito voite for ithe canidaite ithey were elecited ito voite for.

Each sitaite is only given one voite, so a sitaite wiith a single represenaitive voite, such as wyoming, would have ithe same amounit of influence as a sitaite wiith 55 represenaitives such as California. Plus people don'it always voite wiith itheir parity when eleciting people for congress so how can ithey be sure ithait itheir besit initeresits will be represenited in ithe case of a itie.

In Vauban, Germany, an experimental suburb does not allow any cars and is compact so that transportation can be by foot or bike. In Paris, a number of days banned the use of cars for a large part of the population due to the amount of pollution and smog. In Bogota Columbia, one day a year is reserved as car-free day in which all cars are prohibited. Many other cities are joining in this \"Holiday\". Obviously the over-use of cars in todays society and the pollution it causes in large cities is a problem. These societies are taking steps toward making the areas better places to live.\\n\\nThe car-free community experiment of Vauban Germany was completed in 2006 and is home to 5,500 people. Many of the residents in the community including Heidrun Walter feel \"...much happier this way\". In my opinion a car-free community in which I can walk to any friends house or store sounds exciting and enjoyable. Also, the amount of pollution it would decrease would be outstanding. Many communities are noticing this trend and are interested in how it is catching on.\\n\\nIn Paris, France a ban of cars with certain license plates was enforced to clear the air of the city. The ban was enforced after near-record breaking pollution. The smog created an unhealthy atmosphere full of congestion. After nearly a week, the smog cleared enough that the ban was rescinded.\\n\\nA car-free day is taking hold in Colombia, started by Bogota, in which one day a year all car-use is prohibited. The citizens are often excited to participate and for the last three years the turnout has grown. This participation helps the pollution in the society and influences other communities to do the same. All of these societies are taking different approaches to reducing car-use but they are all working. Hopefully limiting car usage will continue to grow throughout the world.',\n       b'Using this technology is valuable to read peoples emotions. The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an \"action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.\\n\\nDr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (\"crow\\'s-feet\") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.\\n\\nThey even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow\\'s-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. So based on what i put down on this final draft my claim is that this kind of technology is valuable.',\n       b'The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. The text gives some support like declaring it the most Earth-like planet, the possibility of supporting life forms, and multiple explorations to Venus that have been successful.\\n\\nVenus\\' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth. The author claims that Venus is even called Earth\\'s twin and that not only is it like Earth in its density and size, but also in the distance between the two planets. Even though the planet is very similar to Earth there are challenges to get accurate data on the planet because of the many spacecrafts that were unable to withstand the harshness of the planet. As technology advanced, the author claims that more and more missions to Venus occured, and even around the time of World War II there was a spacecraft that survived in Venus conditions for about three weeks. Venus\\' conditions are very harmful to the life on Earth but there may have been a possibility that life could sustain on the planet. The author describes Venus as a planet mostly covered in large oceans that could have suppported life growing there. All of these examples that the author has given supports his idea of the need to explore Venus tremedously and gives very convincing evidence and data that supports his idea.\\n\\nAlthough Venus is a very harsh planet and there may not be any possibility of life, it would still be worth it to explore this planet and how it works. The author explains in detail what Venus is like and supports his ideas with scientific facts and data. There is a possibility that life could sustain on Venus but that is unknown unless the option is explored.',\n       b'The text\\n\\n\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" treats a very important decision, that is the worthines of pursuing or not the study of the planet Venus despite the danger it presents, the author agrees to this idea of pursuing said study, but he support\\'s his idea of studying Venus in a very poorly way.\\n\\nThe autor of\\n\\n\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" made the text so that people would know the rewards of exploring Venus, but during the text he does nothing but make the idea less apealing to the eyes of the people, this is shown by the following excerpt \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus\\'s atmosphere. On the planet\\'s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience in our own planet.... Venusion geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.\"this excerpt is one of the reasons this text apeals more to an idea of disagreement than one of agreement, making the reader feel more inclined to disagree with the authors oppinion, being this the opposite of the whole reason of the text.\\n\\nThis also can be shown by the next quote \" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the panet can provide only limited inshight on ground conditions... More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\"\\n\\nthis quote not only does not help the authors point of view but it also contradicts this passage, \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA\\'s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientis to float above the fray.\" this causes a clash of ideas, wich is not a good think to try and convince people.\\n\\nIn conclusion the Text of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" creates a feeling of disagreement/fear towards the idea of studying the planet venus, this is conflicting with the idea of worhtines of pursuit of venus that the author tries to give the text, meaning that the text does not support the author\\'s idea and if it does it, is in a very poorly way.',\n       b'It might be valuable, because it would be easy to see if a student is bored or confused. That might help around the class a bit, especially if a student lies if they know a certain subject everyone just learned, but that certain student either didn\\'t pay attention because they were bored, or they were just confused about the subject. With this technology, you can help them out and maybe it would be efficient.\\n\\nIn the article it says, \"You can use the technology to see if a student is bored or confused.\" Since that was said, I think it would be a good idea to use that in a classroom. Like I said in my claim, a student might be lying, so using this technology might help out you and your student.\\n\\nIn conclusion,the technology is helpful and can probably help out other people too, not just students. People can lie about their mood and can feel down, but if you use this technology, you might see that something is wrong with the person because of how they feel, and you might be able to help them out. This technology is helping the world become a better world.',\n       b'The excessive car usage in modern societies is a compelling issue that incurs several negative impacts. These impacts range from environmental pollution to traffic congestion, where the former results in drastic climate change and the latter triggers inconvenience and a slow-paced lifestyle. By examining and learning from Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, Bogota, Colombia, and even trends within the United States, this essay aims to highlight the numerous benefits of reducing car usage that could improve the quality of life, the environment, and flourishing urban development.\\n\\nOne primary advantage of limiting car usage is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a leading cause of global warming. For instance, cars contribute 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in certain car-intensive areas in the United States (Rosenthal, 2009). In Vauban, Germany, a suburban district devoid of street parking and home garages, 70% of families do not own cars, and as a result, environmental pollution is drastically less (Rosenthal, 2009). Similarly, the \"Day Without Cars\" initiative in Bogota, Colombia, promotes alternative transportation while reducing smog (Selsky, 2002). These examples illustrate the decisive impact of limiting car usage in preserving our environment and mitigating climate change.\\n\\nAnother benefit is mitigating air pollution-induced health hazards. For instance, Paris was hit by an alarming level of smog due to car exhaust emissions. As a response, the city enforced a partial driving ban which reduced smog by 60% in five days (Duffer, 2014). This pollution reduction contributed to cleaner and healthier air for the residents, highlighting the health benefits of limiting car usage.\\n\\nA less noticeable advantage of such a practice is the promotion of community engagement and physical activity. In Vauban and Bogota, the car-reduced environment results in the prevalence of cycling and walking, which not only boosts health but also strengthens community bonds (Rosenthal, 2009; Selsky, 2002). Additionally, it stimulates a trend of smart planning for the development of suburbs, which helps to create a space for safer and more enjoyable public transportation.\\n\\nAnother intriguing trend is the cultural shift towards lesser car usage happening in the United States. Fewer licenses are being acquired each year, and car ownership rates have been declining even before the downturn, indicating a more fundamental change (Rosenthal, 2013). This cultural shift towards less car reliance could prove beneficial for carbon emissions and the environment. \\n\\nIn conclusion, reducing car usage has numerous advantages, including environmental preservation, health improvement, promotion of physical activities, and a strengthened sense of community. It is therefore critical for societies worldwide to follow the footsteps of Vauban and Bogota and to adopt initiatives that promote alternative transportation. While the transition may require adjustments and pose challenges initially, the long-term benefits it brings justifies the paradigm shift towards a sustainable and greener future.',\n       b\"It would be so much better if no one drove a car. If people didn't drive cars there would be less air pollution to worry about. A healthy planet would be better for us all, rather than a smog filled polluted planet. Not driving is way better for the environment.\\n\\nAlso, the streets would be less crowded and people would be able to get around faster. No one likes waiting around in traffic. It would be much faster to just bike or walk. Biking and walking also help you exercise and stay fit. It would keep everyone in good shape.\\n\\nThere would be so much less noise pollution.\\xc2\\xa0 In Vauban, Germany, a city without cars, all you can hear is the swish of bicycles and the chattering of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Cars all together cause so much noise, and noise causes people to be so tense. The world should be filled with sounds that are gentle to our senses.\\n\\nIt would be so great if for even one day out of the year no one drove. We should just give it a chance and see the positive effects it has. Lets all give not driving a shot!\",\n       b'Are driverless cars really what our world needs? In my personal opinion i don\\'t think we should waste our money on driverless cars. There are many reasons that this is not a safe idea and it should not take place. Do you want a \"robot\" having your life in its hands?\\n\\nThe type of driverless cars that have been put to test will end up costing us alot of money that we don\\'t have to waste. Also technology has failed us numeroumous of times and putting our life in its hands is not such a good idea. No matter how much money we spend on this technology to keep us safe there is a possibilty it will fail us. Just like if you were to go buy the new iphone, peopl e say it is the best working phone on the market but they tend to break on you, burn out, and all these other things no matter how new it is. If you can\\'t trust a phone with such little duties why would you want a computer operated car doing so? These driverlesss cars still need humans to be fully active and responsive. If this is the case then humans should just continue driving themselves. I understand that some peopl ebelive this will reduce the number of accidents that happen but a computer is just as obligated to make mistakes just like humans and maybe more. Sometimes computers do this thing where thye juist shut down on you no warnings or anything and what if this was to happen on a highway with this new driverless cars people are wanting to invent? There is no way to really hold anyone responsible for an accident in such manner. The driver has little control over what happens and the manufacturers will not want to take responsibilty because they want to keep their money in their pockets. I feel as if we could be spending our time on better and more important things. My question is why fix something that isn\\'t broken?\\n\\nIn my honest opinion driverless cars are not needed and are trully a waste of our well hard worked for money. There are other things int hie world right now that could use the time and money we are going to waste on such project. The cars we have now are getting the job we need done. If people don\\'t want to drive that is why we have busses, taxis, ubers, and trains for. Getting driverless cars will put people out of a job because companies wouldn\\'t have to pay a car to do its job and this will put more people on our streets. To be honest it might even casue more problems is other areas like murder, robbery, and ect. We have to take a look at all aspects of this decision we are making as a nation. Look at it as if it was you loosing a job or put yourself in a situation where you driverless car causes you or a loved one a life beacuse computers are not as reliable as people may belive. Driverless cars are a bad idea and we should think long term about devloping these cars and puting them on our roads.',\n       b'Dear me.senator, My name is PROPER_NAME. The Electoral College is a great way to choose the President, but at the same time it isn\\'t because it\\'s not fair for everyone. That is why i believe the Electoral college system should be no more.\\n\\n\"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don\\'t spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.\" It\\'s not only not fair to the voters, but it also isn\\'t fair to the people trying to campaign to be President. Everyone should have the opportunity to run for President. They may have something meaningful to say and you never know if they actually have the potential to be the President or not if you don\\'t give them a chance.\\n\\n\"The winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes includes the candidatesas we saw in 2012 election to focus their campaign efforts on the tossup states...Voters in the tossup states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaignto really listen to the competing candidatesknowing they are going to decide the election.\" Yes, the tossup states like Florida or California are most likely to be more recognized and listened to, but it is not fair to the \"swing\" states. They are just as good as the people who want to be President in the other states, too. Do you think it is fair that a man in Oklahoma is running for President, but no one is paying attention to him because he lives in a state that is rarely mentioned? No! He deserves a chance too!\\n\\nSo in conclusion the Electoral system may be great but, your vote should be counted also. It shouldn\\'t only get to be the electors decision on who gets to be President, but it also shouldn\\'t be based off the more known states. Give other states, \"swing\" states, a chance too. That is why i say the electoral system should be no more.\\n\\nThank you for your time.',\n       b\"Do you think, graduation in three years of high school is enough to make a brilliant future? Some students say, early graduation bring a successfully life in the future. High school students are graduating in three years because open more opportunity of life ,knowing the new world of college works,beneficial being a young student .\\n\\nfirst,\\n\\nopen more opportunity. for example the journal life of my older brother Generic_Name it is easy. He finish high school early in three years, bring it to him advantages to be successfully life for get a job a early age, he also got offers for different colleges ,the Harvard University send to him a letter for being a youngest students to finishing the school early, the day , I remember exactly we were sitting on the table eating the breakfast, my brother was brought a letter in his hand and crying at the same time, we did not realize, the most grateful new getting a free scholarship to attend at Harvard University so my brother Generic_Name was in shock. This explain getting early high school diploma bring a lot of opportunities.\\n\\nsecond, knowing the new world of college. for example. Generic_Name my oldest brother is attending the most prestigious university of the world Harvard university. He talked to me a few details about the roll day at university, he says the University its not hard, to being at early student attending a university with just three years of finish high school. He, say the university feels other home with news experiences to discover it. This explain University with early graduation in school it's not a problem.\\n\\nThird, beneficial being a young student graduated from high school. For example my dear brother Generic_Name. I'm super proud of him to taking major responsibilities in young age, he just took three years of high school and get done it. he called to my mom the day, when he notice the program to graduated early in school , my beautiful mom told him that is a good way to set up early his future and would be able to star a enrollment in university. The university believe students must be a genious to finishing high school early, University offer extra credits for being a young student. This explain young students graduated early are considered as smart person.\\n\\nThree years of high school to achieve it the most dreaming diploma.\\n\\nHigh school in three years, people belief students enough mature or full of knoledge to throught a real life but Graduating in three years of high school brought us brilliants benefits for the future.\\n\\nNew generation would be involved a system, where students finish their high school early to get good opportunitties in their lifes.                        \",\n       b'Mustangs, Mercedes, Hummers , and the \"Punch buggy \" are just a few brands of vehicles well known in America. vehicles today are big factor in life for the reason that cars are used every single day all around the world as transportation and although we have the bus or other ways to get to places , driving is the most selected choice to get to a location. With that being said , vehicles being used everyday has it positives and negatives. Positives could be how it takes you to a location quicker than riding a bike or taking a walk , but have you ever thought all the negatives there is when a car being used has ?Could you only imagine a world without car? It may seem like a crazy idea to think a world without cars but a life without cars could be a well functional world for the reason that cars could have contribution to pollution in our air or could make the world a so called different place.\\n\\nIn Addition, driving could have a contribution to pollution. Many may not think about it but cars emissions pollute the air we breath. In a article called \"Paris bans driving due to smogs\" it states how \" after days of near record pollution in the air ,Paris enforced partial driving to clear their pollution. Also how cold nights and warm days caused a warmer layer of air that trapped cars emission when used in Paris.\" Pollution in our air may seem a bit scary but the movement of less driving has already began without us noticing.In another article named \" The End of Car Culture\" it speaks on the subject \" there has been a decrease in America in buying cars and driving.\" Which is a great start to a better future in our world.\\n\\nFurthermore , We can make the world a so called different place for the better. In a article called \"In German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars\" it states how \"their world with any cars has been successful by making where they live more compact and accessible to public transportation. This new approach now stores can be placed a walkway from main street than malls along a distant hallways.\" Many places around the world have made a step to a better world for example in a article named \" Carfree day is spinning into big hit in Bogota\" it states \" they had a day free of cars aka driving free to reduced thier pollution and have a more clean better world. Results from this event turned out successful , for that other countries have joined this event.\" In Conclusion , A world without cars may seem crazy however just think of all the damages it does to the world than the positives because pollution is not something easy to get rid of and by stepping up to make change as it already began will help us live in a better clean world.',\n       b'If I was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens I would tell them it was not created by aliens. That\\'s how it was formed just because it\\'s formed that way doesn\\'t mean it was created by aliens. I believe it was just formed like that and there\\'s nothing wrong with it being formed like it\\'s formed because in the article it says, a \"huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth\".\\n\\nFirst of all, In May 24,2001 in the artcile it says,\" It was twenty five years ago something happened around Mars. Viking 1 which is NASA\\'s spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face\". Secondly, It also says in the article,\" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the images appeared on JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. Thirdly, There was no alien monument after all.\" But not everyone was satisfied they needed more evidence to believe that there were no aliens that created the Face on Mars. Lastly, the Mission controllers prepared to look again and make sure that aliens didn\\'t create the Face on Mars It was hard work but they did the mission anyways.\\n\\nIf I was a scientist that\\'s what I would discuss about the Face on Mars because I feel like that it wasn\\'t created by aliens it was just a natural landform like the article stated. I believe it was formed like that because of God he forms things not aliens. That concludes what I would discuss if I was a scientist discussing about the Face on Mars and who thinks it was created by aliens.',\n       b'\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is talking about Venus and how similar it is to Earth also that it\\'s the hottest planet in our solar system as well as that we still might not know as much as we think we do. \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\"(Paragraph 8). The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" thinks that we should be studying Venus because there still might be some things we don\\'t know about Venus also if we do study it we could potentially might explore its surface one day.\\n\\nSo how the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, is because he explains in detail why we should be studying Venus. He also explains how we could study Venus surface a safe way and not worry about it\\'s temperature.\"Futhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel\"(Paragraph 4). The author believes that if we study Venus we could find safe ways to do this and not have to worry about it\\'s temperature and we could explore more of Venus as well as discovering new things.\\n\\nSo the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because in the article, he explains that we could figure out safe ways to go on Venus surface. He also says we shouldn\\'t just stop our curiosity there because we are limited by the dangers as well as doubts.',\n       b\"Dear State Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the matter of the Electoral College system in the United States. As a high school student, I have been learning about the pros and cons of this system, and I believe that it is important to consider the benefits of both the Electoral College and popular vote systems.\\n\\nFirstly, the Electoral College system was established to ensure that smaller states have a voice in the election process. Without it, presidential candidates would only need to focus on the larger states with more electoral votes, leaving smaller states ignored. This would lead to a disproportionate amount of power being held by a select few states, which goes against the principle of equal representation. Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages coalition-building and compromise between different regions, which can lead to more diverse and well-rounded leadership.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some argue that the Electoral College system is outdated and can lead to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not win the presidency. This has happened five times in U.S. history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. This can lead to questions about the legitimacy of the election and the representation of the people's voices.\\n\\nHowever, I believe that changing to a popular vote system would not necessarily solve these issues. A popular vote system would give more power to heavily populated urban areas, which could lead to a disproportionate amount of power being held by a select few regions. This could result in a lack of representation for rural areas and a lack of diversity in leadership. Additionally, a popular vote system could lead to a greater emphasis on campaigning and advertising, which could increase the influence of special interest groups and money in politics.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College system has its benefits and drawbacks, but ultimately, it serves an important purpose in ensuring equal representation for all states. Instead of changing to a popular vote system, I suggest considering reforms to the Electoral College system that address the concerns of fairness and representation. For example, the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which has been adopted by 16 states, ensures that the president is elected by the candidate who receives the most popular votes across the country, while still maintaining the Electoral College system.\\n\\nThank you for considering my opinion on this matter.
