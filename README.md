# AI-Generated Text Detector

The AI-Generated Text Detector is a machine-learning model designed to detect and classify AI-generated text. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify text generated by AI systems, such as language models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models.

## Features:
- **Data Preparation**: Use pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements TensorFlow and Keras for building and training deep learning models.
- **Text Processing**: Uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization of text data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Us sklearn for model evaluation and performance metrics calculation.
- **Visualization**: Use seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization and result interpretation.

## Usage:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed, including TensorFlow, NLTK, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, and keras_nlp.
2. Prepare training data consisting of both AI-generated text and human-generated text.
3. Preprocess the data, tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing as required.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Build and train the deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
7. Visualize the results using seaborn and matplotlib.
